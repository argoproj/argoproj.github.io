The core concept of the project are <code>sensors</code> which are implemented as Kubernetes-native Custom Resource Definition that define a set of dependencies (signals) and actions (triggers). The sensor\'s triggers will only be fired after it\'s signals have been resolved. <code>Sensors</code> can trigger once or repeatedly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define multiple dependencies from a variety of signal sources</li>\n<li>Build custom signal microservices to support business-level constraint logic</li>\n<li>Trigger messages and Kubernetes object creation after successful dependency resolution</li>\n<li>Trigger escalation after errors, or dependency constraint failures</li>\n<li>Build and manage a distributed, cross-team, event-driven architecture</li>\n<li>Easily leverage Kubernetes-native APIs to monitor dependencies</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why Argo Events?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Runtime agnostic. The first runtime and package agnostic event framework for Kubernetes.</li>\n<li>Containers. Designed from the ground-up as Kubernetes-native. </li>\n<li>Extremely lightweight. All signals, with the exception of calendar-based signals, are event-driven, meaning that there is no polling involved.</li>\n<li>Configurable. Choose which signals to support and only deploy those you want to Kubernetes.</li>\n<li>Scalability &#x26; Resilient. Signal sources run as stateless microservices enabling you to easily scale.</li>\n<li>Simple or Complex dependencies. Manage everything from simple, linear, real-time dependencies to complex, multi-source, batch job dependencies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>Argo Events is a Kubernetes CRD which can manage dependencies using kubectl commands.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="./docs/signal-guide.html">Learn about signals</a></li>\n<li><a href="./docs/trigger-guide.html">Learn about triggers</a></li>\n<li><a href="./docs/quickstart.html">Getting started</a></li>\n<li><a href="./CONTRIBUTING.html">Want to contribute or develop/run locally?</a></li>\n<li>See where the project is headed in the <a href="./ROADMAP.html">roadmap</a></li>\n</ul>',docPath:"argo-events/readme",proj:"argo-events"}}}});
