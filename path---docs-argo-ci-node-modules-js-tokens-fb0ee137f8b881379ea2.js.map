So only the standard <code>g</code>, <code>m</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>u</code> flags are\\nallowed. This means that the above example will be identified as division as\\nlong as you don’t rename the <code>e</code> variable to some permutation of <code>gmiyu</code> 1 to 5\\ncharacters long.</p>\\n<p>Lastly, we can look <em>forward</em> for information.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>If the token following what looks like a regex literal is not valid after a\\nregex literal, but is valid in a division expression, then the regex literal\\nis treated as division instead.
