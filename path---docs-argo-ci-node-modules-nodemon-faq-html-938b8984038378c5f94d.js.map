This way if the script crashes, forever restarts the script, and if there are file changes, nodemon restarts your script. For more detail, see <a href=\\\"https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/30\\\">issue 30</a>.</p>\\n<p>To achieve this you need to add the following on the call to <code>forever</code>:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Use forever's <code>-c nodemon</code> option to tell forever to run <code>nodemon</code> instead of <code>node</code>.</li>\\n<li>Include the nodemon <code>--exitcrash</code> flag to ensure nodemon exits if the script crashes (or exits unexpectedly).</li>\\n<li>Tell forever to use <code>SIGTERM</code> instead of <code>SIGKILL</code> when requesting nodemon to stop. This ensures that nodemon can stop the watched node process cleanly.</li>\\n<li>Optionally add the <code>--uid</code> parameter, adding a unique name for your process. In the example, the uid is set to <code>foo</code>.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">forever start --uid foo --killSignal=SIGTERM -c 'nodemon --exitcrash' server.js\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>To test this, you can kill the server.js process and forever will restart it. If you <code>touch server.js</code> nodemon will restart it.</p>\\n<p>To stop the process monitored by forever and nodemon, simply call the following, using the <code>uid</code> we assigned above (<code>foo</code>):</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">forever stop foo\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This will stop both nodemon and the node process it was monitoring.</p>\\n<p>Note that I <em>would not</em> recommend using nodemon in a production environment - but that's because I wouldn't want it restart without my explicit instruction.</p>\\n<h2>What does \\\"verbose\\\" give me?</h2>\\n<p>The <code>--verbose</code> (or <code>-V</code>) puts nodemon in verbose mode which adds some detail to starting and restarting.</p>\\n<p>Additional restart information:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Which nodemon configs are loaded (local and global if found)</li>\\n<li>Which ignore rules are being applied</li>\\n<li>Which file extensions are being watch</li>\\n<li>The process ID of your application (the <code>child pid</code>)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For example:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">14 Apr 15:24:58 - [nodemon] v1.0.17\\n14 Apr 15:24:58 - [nodemon] reading config /Users/remy/Sites/jsbin-private/nodemon.json\\n14 Apr 15:24:58 - [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`\\n14 Apr 15:24:58 - [nodemon] ignoring: /Users/remy/Sites/jsbin-private/.git/**/* node_modules/**/node_modules\\n14 Apr 15:24:58 - [nodemon] watching: /Users/remy/Sites/jsbin/views/**/* /Users/remy/Sites/jsbin/lib/**/* ../json/*.json config.dev.json\\n14 Apr 15:24:58 - [nodemon] watching extensions: json,js,html\\n14 Apr 15:24:58 - [nodemon] starting `node run.js`\\n14 Apr 15:24:58 - [nodemon] child pid: 9292\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>When nodemon detects a change, the following addition information is shown:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Which file(s) triggered the check</li>\\n<li>Which (if any) rules the file matched to cause a subsequent restart</li>\\n<li>How many rules were matched and out of those rules, how many cause a restart</li>\\n<li>A list of all the files that <em>successfully</em> caused a restart</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For example, on <code>lib/app.js</code> being changed:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">14 Apr 15:25:56 - [nodemon] files triggering change check: ../jsbin/lib/app.js\\n14 Apr 15:25:56 - [nodemon] matched rule: **/Users/remy/Sites/jsbin/lib/**/*\\n14 Apr 15:25:56 - [nodemon] changes after filters (before/after): 1/1\\n14 Apr 15:25:56 - [nodemon] restarting due to changes...\\n14 Apr 15:25:56 - [nodemon] ../jsbin/lib/app.js\\n\\n14 Apr 15:25:56 - [nodemon] starting `node run.js`\\n14 Apr 15:25:56 - [nodemon] child pid: 9556\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>My .nodemonignore is being ignored</h2>\\n<p>The new <code>nodemon.json</code> superceeds the <code>.nodemonignore</code> file, so if you have both, the <code>.nodemonignore</code> is not used at all.</p>\\n<p>Note that if you have a <code>nodemon.json</code> in your <code>$HOME</code> path, then this will also supersede the old ignore file.</p>\\n<h2>nodemon does nothing</h2>\\n<p>On Ubuntu globally installed node applications have been found to have no output when they're run.
