Read the FAQ</h2>\n<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/FAQ">read the FAQ</a> before logging new issues, even if you think you have found a bug.</p>\n<p>Issues that ask questions answered in the FAQ will be closed without elaboration.</p>\n<h2>2. Search for Duplicates</h2>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&#x26;q=is%3Aissue">Search the existing issues</a> before logging a new one.</p>\n<h2>3. Do you have a question?</h2>\n<p>The issue tracker is for <strong>issues</strong>, in other words, bugs and suggestions.\nIf you have a <em>question</em>, please use <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/typescript">Stack Overflow</a>, <a href="https://gitter.im/Microsoft/TypeScript">Gitter</a>, your favorite search engine, or other resources.\nDue to increased traffic, we can no longer answer questions in the issue tracker.</p>\n<h2>4. Did you find a bug?</h2>\n<p>When logging a bug, please be sure to include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What version of TypeScript you\'re using (run <code>tsc --v</code>)</li>\n<li>If at all possible, an <em>isolated</em> way to reproduce the behavior</li>\n<li>The behavior you expect to see, and the actual behavior</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can try out the nightly build of TypeScript (<code>npm install typescript@next</code>) to see if the bug has already been fixed.</p>\n<h2>5. Do you have a suggestion?</h2>\n<p>We also accept suggestions in the issue tracker.\nBe sure to <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/FAQ">check the FAQ</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&#x26;q=is%3Aissue">search</a> first.</p>\n<p>In general, things we find useful when reviewing suggestions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A description of the problem you\'re trying to solve</li>\n<li>An overview of the suggested solution</li>\n<li>\n<p>Examples of how the suggestion would work in various places</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Code examples showing e.g. "this would be an error, this wouldn\'t"</li>\n<li>Code examples showing the generated JavaScript (if applicable)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If relevant, precedent in other languages can be useful for establishing context and expected behavior</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Instructions for Contributing Code</h1>\n<h2>Contributing bug fixes</h2>\n<p>TypeScript is currently accepting contributions in the form of bug fixes. A bug must have an issue tracking it in the issue tracker that has been approved ("Milestone == Community") by the TypeScript team. Your pull request should include a link to the bug that you are fixing. If you\'ve submitted a PR for a bug, please post a comment in the bug to avoid duplication of effort.</p>\n<h2>Contributing features</h2>\n<p>Features (things that add new or improved functionality to TypeScript) may be accepted, but will need to first be approved (marked as "Milestone == Community" by a TypeScript coordinator with the message "Approved") in the suggestion issue. Features with language design impact, or that are adequately satisfied with external tools, will not be accepted.</p>\n<p>Design changes will not be accepted at this time. If you have a design change proposal, please log a suggestion issue.</p>\n<h2>Legal</h2>\n<p>You will need to complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Briefly, this agreement testifies that you are granting us permission to use the submitted change according to the terms of the project\'s license, and that the work being submitted is under appropriate copyright.</p>\n<p>Please submit a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before submitting a pull request.

If your PR does not match this criteria, please specify why</li>\n<li>Tests should include reasonable permutations of the target fix/change</li>\n<li>Include baseline changes with your change</li>\n<li>All changed code must have 100% code coverage</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Follow the code conventions described in <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines">Coding guidelines</a></li>\n<li>To avoid line ending issues, set <code>autocrlf = input</code> and <code>whitespace = cr-at-eol</code> in your git configuration</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributing <code>lib.d.ts</code> fixes</h2>\n<p>The library sources are in: <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/tree/master/src/lib">src/lib</a></p>\n<p>Library files in <code>built/local/</code> are updated by running</p>\n<pre><code class="language-Shell">jake\n</code></pre>\n<p>The files in <code>lib/</code> are used to bootstrap compilation and usually do not need to be updated.</p>\n<h4><code>src/lib/dom.generated.d.ts</code> and <code>src/lib/webworker.generated.d.ts</code></h4>\n<p>These two files represent the DOM typings and are auto-generated. To make any modifications to them, please submit a PR to  <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TSJS-lib-generator">https://github.com/Microsoft/TSJS-lib-generator</a></p>\n<h2>Running the Tests</h2>\n<p>To run all tests, invoke the <code>runtests-parallel</code> target using jake:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-Shell">jake runtests-parallel\n</code></pre>\n<p>This run will all tests; to run only a specific subset of tests, use:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-Shell">jake runtests tests=&#x3C;regex>\n</code></pre>\n<p>e.g. to run all compiler baseline tests:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-Shell">jake runtests tests=compiler\n</code></pre>\n<p>or to run a specific test: <code>tests\\cases\\compiler\\2dArrays.ts</code> </p>\n<pre><code class="language-Shell">jake runtests tests=2dArrays\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Debugging the tests</h2>\n<p>To debug the tests, invoke the <code>runtests-browser</code> task from jake.\nYou will probably only want to debug one test at a time:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-Shell">jake runtests-browser tests=2dArrays\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can specify which browser to use for debugging. Currently Chrome and IE are supported:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-Shell">jake runtests-browser tests=2dArrays browser=chrome\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can debug with VS Code or Node instead with <code>jake runtests debug=true</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-Shell">jake runtests tests=2dArrays debug=true\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Adding a Test</h2>\n<p>To add a new test case, simply place a <code>.ts</code> file in <code>tests\\cases\\compiler</code> containing code that exemplifies the bugfix or change you are making.</p>\n<p>These files support metadata tags in the format  <code>// @metaDataName: value</code>.\nThe supported names and values are the same as those supported in the compiler itself, with the addition of the <code>fileName</code> flag.\n<code>fileName</code> tags delimit sections of a file to be used as separate compilation units.\nThey are useful for tests relating to modules.\nSee below for examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong> that if you have a test corresponding to a specific spec compliance item, you can place it in <code>tests\\cases\\conformance</code> in an appropriately-named subfolder.\n<strong>Note</strong> that filenames here must be distinct from all other compiler testcase names, so you may have to work a bit to find a unique name if it\'s something common.</p>\n<h3>Tests for multiple files</h3>\n<p>When one needs to test for scenarios which require multiple files, it is useful to use the <code>fileName</code> metadata tag as such:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-TypeScript">// @fileName: file1.ts\nexport function f() {\n}\n\n// @fileName: file2.ts\nimport { f as g } from "file1";\n\nvar x = g();\n</code></pre>\n<p>One can also write a project test, but it is slightly more involved.</p>\n<h2>Managing the Baselines</h2>\n<p>Compiler testcases generate baselines that track the emitted <code>.js</code>, the errors produced by the compiler, and the type of each expression in the file. Additionally, some testcases opt in to baselining the source map output.</p>\n<p>When a change in the baselines is detected, the test will fail. To inspect changes vs the expected baselines, use</p>\n<pre><code class="language-Shell">jake diff\n</code></pre>\n<p>After verifying that the changes in the baselines are correct, run</p>\n<pre><code class="language-Shell">jake baseline-accept\n</code></pre>\n<p>to establish the new baselines as the desired behavior. This will change the files in <code>tests\\baselines\\reference</code>, which should be included as part of your commit. It\'s important to carefully validate changes in the baselines.</p>',docPath:"argo-ci/node_modules/typescript/contributing",proj:"argo-ci"}}}});
