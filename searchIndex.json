During reconciliation, the controller no longer performs expensive, in-line queries of app\nrelated resources in K8s API server, instead relying on the metadata available in the live state \ncache. This dramatically improves performance and responsiveness, and is less burdensome to the K8s\nAPI server.\nObject relationship visualization for CRDs\nWith the new controller design, Argo CD is now able to understand ownership relationship between\nall Kubernetes objects, not just the built-in types. This enables Argo CD to visualize\nparent/child relationships between all kubernetes objects, including CRDs.\nMulti-namespaced applications\nDuring sync, Argo CD will now honor any explicitly set namespace in a manifest. Manifests without a\nnamespace will continue deploy to the \"preferred\" namespace, as specified in app's\nspec.destination.namespace. This enables support for a class of applications which install to\nmultiple namespaces. For example, Argo CD can now install the\nprometheus-operator\nhelm chart, which deploys some resources into kube-system, and others into the\nprometheus-operator namespace.\nLarge application support\nFull resource objects are no longer stored in the Application CRD object status. Instead, only\nlightweight metadata is stored in the status, such as a resource's sync and health status.\nThis change enabled Argo CD to support applications with a very large number of resources \n(e.g. istio), and reduces the bandwidth requirements when listing applications in the UI.\nResource lifecycle hook improvements\nResource lifecycle hooks (e.g. PreSync, PostSync) are now visible/manageable from the UI.\nAdditionally, bare Pods with a restart policy of Never can now be used as a resource hook, as an\nalternative to Jobs, Workflows.\nK8s recommended application labels\nThe tracking label for resources has been changed to use app.kubernetes.io/instance, as\nrecommended in Kubernetes recommended labels,\n(changed from applications.argoproj.io/app-name). This will enable applications managed by Argo CD\nto interoperate with other tooling which are also converging on this labeling, such as the\nKubernetes dashboard. Additionally, Argo CD no longer injects any tracking labels at the\nspec.template.metadata level.\nExternal OIDC provider support\nArgo CD now supports auth delegation to an existing, external OIDC providers without the need for\nrunning Dex (e.g. Okta, OneLogin, Auth0, Microsoft, etc...)\nThe optional, Dex IDP OIDC provider is still bundled as part of the\ndefault installation, in order to provide a seamless out-of-box experience, enabling Argo CD to\nintegrate with non-OIDC providers, and to benefit from Dex's full range of\nconnectors.\nOIDC group bindings to Project Roles\nOIDC group claims from an OAuth2 provider can now be bound to a Argo CD project roles. Previously,\ngroup claims could only be managed in the centralized ConfigMap, argocd-rbac-cm. They can now be\nmanaged at a project level. This enables project admins to self service access to applications\nwithin a project.\nDeclarative Argo CD configuration\nArgo CD settings can be now be configured either declaratively, or imperatively. The argocd-cm\nConfigMap now has a repositories field, which can reference credentials in a normal Kubernetes\nsecret which you can create declaratively, outside of Argo CD.\nHelm repository support\nHelm repositories can be configured at the system level, enabling the deployment of helm charts\nwhich have a dependency to external helm repositories.\nBreaking changes:\n\nArgo CD's resource names were renamed for consistency. For example, the application-controller\ndeployment was renamed to argocd-application-controller. When upgrading from v0.10 to v0.11,\nthe older resources should be pruned to avoid inconsistent state and controller in-fighting.\n\nAs a consequence to moving to recommended kubernetes labels, when upgrading from v0.10 to v0.11,\nall applications will immediately be OutOfSync due to the change in tracking labels. This will\ncorrect itself with another sync of the application. However, since Pods will be recreated, please\ntake this into consideration, especially if your applications are configured with auto-sync.\n\nThere was significant reworking of the app.status fields to reduce the payload size, simplify\nthe datastructure and remove fields which were no longer used by the controller. No breaking\nchanges were made in app.spec.\n\nAn older Argo CD CLI (v0.10 and below) will not be compatible with Argo CD v0.11. To keep\nCI pipelines in sync with the API server, it is recommended to have pipelines download the CLI\ndirectly from the API server https://${ARGOCD_SERVER}/download/argocd-linux-amd64 during the CI\npipeline.\n\n\nChanges since v0.10:\n\nImprove Application state reconciliation performance (#806)\nRefactor, consolidate and rename resource type data structures\nDeclarative setup and configuration of ArgoCD (#536)\nDeclaratively add helm repositories (#747)\nSwitch to k8s recommended app.kubernetes.io/instance label (#857)\nAbility for a single application to deploy into multiple namespaces (#696)\nSelf service group access to project applications (#742)\nSupport for Pods as a sync hook (#801)\nSupport 'crd-install' helm hook (#355)\nUse external 'diff' utility to render actual vs target state difference\nShow sync policy in app list view\nRemove resources state from application CRD (#758)\nAPI server & UI should serve argocd binaries instead of linking to GitHub (#716)\nUpdate versions for kubectl (v1.13.1), helm (v2.12.1), ksonnet (v0.13.1)\nUpdate version of aws-iam-authenticator (0.4.0-alpha.1)\nAbility to force refresh of application manifests from git\nImprove diff assessment for Secrets, ClusterRoles, Roles\nFailed to deploy helm chart with local dependencies and no internet access (#786)\nOut of sync reported if Secrets with stringData are used (#763)\nUnable to delete application in K8s v1.12 (#718)\n\nv0.10.6 (2018-11-14)\n\nFix issue preventing in-cluster app sync due to go-client changes (issue #774)\n\nv0.10.5 (2018-11-13)\n\nIncrease concurrency of application controller\nUpdate dependencies to k8s v1.12 and client-go v9.0 (#729)\nadd argo cluster permission to view logs (#766) (@conorfennell)\nFix issue where applications could not be deleted on k8s v1.12\nAllow 'syncApplication' action to reference target revision rather then hard-coding to 'HEAD' (#69) (@chrisgarland)\nIssue #768 -

For example, the following are the parameters\navailable in the guestbook app, all of which belong to the guestbook-ui component:\n$ ks param list\nCOMPONENT    PARAM         VALUE\n=========    =====         =====\nguestbook-ui containerPort 80\nguestbook-ui image         \"gcr.io/heptio-images/ks-guestbook-demo:0.1\"\nguestbook-ui name          \"guestbook-ui\"\nguestbook-ui replicas      1\nguestbook-ui servicePort   80\nguestbook-ui type          \"LoadBalancer\"When overriding ksonnet parameters in Argo CD, the component name should also be specified in the\nargocd app set command, in the form of -p COMPONENT=PARAM=VALUE. For example:\nargocd app set guestbook-default -p guestbook-ui=image=gcr.io/heptio-images/ks-guestbook-demo:0.1Helm\nValues Files\nHelm has the ability to use a different, or even multiple \"values.yaml\" files to derive its\nparameters from. Alternate or multiple values file(s), can be specified using the --values\nflag. The flag can be repeated to support multiple values files:\nargocd app set helm-guestbook --values values-production.yamlHelm Parameters\nHelm has the ability to set parameter values, which override any values in\na values.yaml. For example, service.type is a common parameter which is exposed in a Helm chart:\nhelm template . --set service.type=LoadBalancerSimilarly Argo CD can override values in the values.yaml parameters using argo app set command,\nin the form of -p PARAM=VALUE. For example:\nargocd app set helm-guestbook -p service.type=LoadBalancerHelm Hooks\nHelm hooks are equivalent in concept to Argo CD resource hooks. In helm, a hook\nis any normal kubernetes resource annotated with the helm.sh/hook annotation. When Argo CD deploys\nhelm application which contains helm hooks, all helm hook resources are currently ignored during\nthe kubectl apply of the manifests. There is an\nopen issue to map Helm hooks to Argo CD's concept\nof Pre/Post/Sync hooks.\nRandom Data\nHelm templating has the ability to generate random data during chart rendering via the\nrandAlphaNum function. Many helm charts from the charts repository\nmake use of this feature. For example, the following is the secret for the\nredis helm chart:\ndata:\n  {{- if .Values.password }}\n  redis-password: {{ .Values.password | b64enc | quote }}\n  {{- else }}\n  redis-password: {{ randAlphaNum 10 | b64enc | quote }}\n  {{- end }}The Argo CD application controller periodically compares git state against the live state, running\nthe helm template <CHART> command to generate the helm manifests. Because the random value is\nregenerated every time the comparison is made, any application which makes use of the randAlphaNum\nfunction will always be in an OutOfSync state. This can be mitigated by explicitly setting a\nvalue, in the values.yaml such that the value is stable between each comparison. For example:\nargocd app set redis -p password=abc123"},"argo-cd/docs/architecture":{"id":"argo-cd/docs/architecture","title":"argo-cd/docs/architecture","body":"Argo CD - Architectural Overview\n\nComponents\nAPI Server\nThe API server is a gRPC/REST server which exposes the API consumed by the Web UI, CLI, and CI/CD \nsystems.

A benefit of automatic sync is that\nCI/CD pipelines no longer need direct access to the Argo CD API server to perform the deployment.\nInstead, the pipeline makes a commit and push to the git repository with the changes to the\nmanifests in the tracking git repo.\nTo configure automated sync run:\nargocd app set <APPNAME> --sync-policy automated\nAlternatively, if creating the application an application manifest, specify a syncPolicy with an\nautomated policy.\nspec:\n  syncPolicy:\n    automated: {}\nAutomatic Pruning\nBy default (and as a safety mechanism), automated sync will not delete resources when Argo CD detects\nthe resource is no longer defined in git.

There will be times\nwhen you wish to modify just the manifests without triggering an entire CI build. For example,\nyou likely do not want to trigger a build if you simply wish to bump the number of replicas in\na Deployment spec.\n\nCleaner audit log. For auditing purposes, a repo which only holds configuration will have a much\ncleaner git history of what changes were made, without the noise coming from check-ins due to\nnormal development activity.\n\nYour application may be comprised of services built from multiple git repositories, but is\ndeployed as a single unit. Oftentimes, microservices applications are comprised of services\nwith different versioning schemes, and release cycles (e.g. ELK, Kafka + Zookeeper). It may not\nmake sense to store the manifests in one of the source code repositories of a single component.\n\nSeparation of access. The developers who are developing the application, may not necessarily be \nthe same people who can/should push to production environments, either intentionally or\nunintentionally. By having separate repos, commit access can be given to the source code repo,\nand not the application config repo.\n\nIf you are automating your CI pipeline, pushing manifest changes to the same git repository can\ntrigger an infinite loop of build jobs and git commit triggers. Having a separate repo to push\nconfig changes to, prevents this from happening.\n\n\nLeaving room for imperativeness\nIt may be desired to leave room for some imperativeness/automation, and not have everything defined\nin your git manifests. For example, if you want the number of your deployment's replicas to be\nmanaged by Horizontal Pod Autoscaler,\nthen you would not want to track replicas in git.\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-deployment\nspec:\n  # do not include replicas in the manifests if you want replicas to be controlled by HPA\n  # replicas: 1\n  template:\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - image: nginx:1.7.9\n        name: nginx\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n...\nEnsuring manifests at git revisions are truly immutable\nWhen using templating tools like helm or kustomize, it is possible for manifests to change\ntheir meaning from one day to the next. This is typically caused by changes made to an upstream helm\nrepository or kustomize base.\nFor example, consider the following kustomization.yaml\nbases:\n- github.com/argoproj/argo-cd//manifests/cluster-install\nThe above kustomization has a remote base to he HEAD revision of the argo-cd repo. Since this\nis not stable target, the manifests for this kustomize application can suddenly change meaning, even without\nany changes to your own git repository.\nA better version would be to use a git tag or commit SHA.

This is\n useful so that the CLI used in the CI pipeline is always kept in-sync and uses argocd binary\n that is always compatible with the Argo CD API server.\n export ARGOCD_SERVER=argocd.mycompany.com\n export ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN=<JWT token generated from project>\n curl -sSL -o /usr/local/bin/argocd https://${ARGOCD_SERVER}/download/argocd-linux-amd64\n argocd app sync guestbook\n argocd app wait guestbook If automated synchronization is configured for the application, this step is\n unnecessary.

Sometimes, it may be desired to use a specific version of a tool\nother than what Argo CD bundles. Some reasons to do this might be:\n\nTo upgrade/downgrade to a specific version of a tool due to bugs or bug fixes.\nTo install additional dependencies which to be used by kustomize's configmap/secret generators\n(e.g. curl, vault, gpg, AWS CLI)\nIn the future, to install a custom templating tool\n\nAs the Argo CD repo-server is the single service responsible for generating Kubernetes manifests, it\ncan be customized to use alternative toolchain required by your environment.\nAdding tools via volume mounts\nThe first technique is to use an init container and a volumeMount to copy a different verison of\na tool into the repo-server container. In the following example, an init container is overwriting\nthe helm binary with a different version than what is bundled in Argo CD:\n    spec:\n      # 1. Define an emptyDir volume which will hold the custom binaries\n      volumes:\n      - name: custom-tools\n        emptyDir: {}\n      # 2.

Some reasons for this might be:\n\nThere is a bug in the manifest, where it contains extra/unknown fields from the actual K8s spec. These extra fields would get dropped when querying Kubernetes for the live state,\nresulting in an OutOfSync status indicating a missing field was detected.\nThe sync was performed (with pruning disabled), and there are resources which need to be deleted.\nA controller or mutating webhook is altering the object after it was\nsubmitted to Kubernetes in a manner which contradicts Git.\nA Helm chart is using a template function such as randAlphaNum,\nwhich generates different data every time helm template is invoked.\nFor Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) objects, the HPA controller is known to reorder spec.metrics\nin a specific order. See kubernetes issue #74099.\nTo work around this, you can order spec.replicas in git in the same order that the controller\nprefers.\n\nIn case it is impossible to fix the upstream issue, Argo CD allows you to optionally ignore differences of problematic resources.\nThe diffing customization can be configured for single or multiple application resources or at a system level.\nApplication level configuration\nArgo CD allows ignoring differences at a specific JSON path. The following sample application is configured to ignore differences in spec.replicas for all deployments:\nspec:\n  ignoreDifferences:\n  - group: apps\n    kind: Deployment\n    jsonPointers:\n    - /spec/replicas\nThe above customization could be narrowed to a resource with the specified name and optional namespace:\nspec:\n  ignoreDifferences:\n  - group: apps\n    kind: Deployment\n    name: guestbook\n    namespace: default\n    jsonPointers:\n    - /spec/replicas\nSystem-level configuration\nThe comparison of resources with well-known issues can be customized at a system level. Ignored differences can be configured for a specified group and kind\nin resource.customizations key of argocd-cm ConfigMap.

The Ingress and StatefulSet types have known issues which might cause health check\nto return Progressing state instead of Healthy.\n\nIngress is considered healthy if status.loadBalancer.ingress list is non-empty, with at least one value for hostname or IP.

Install Argo CD\nkubectl create namespace argocd\nkubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml\nThis will create a new namespace, argocd, where Argo CD services and application resources will live.\nNOTE:\n\nOn GKE, you will need grant your account the ability to create new cluster roles:  kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOURNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUREMAIL@gmail.com\n\n\n2. Download Argo CD CLI\nDownload the latest Argo CD version from https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/latest.\nAlso available in Mac Homebrew:\nbrew tap argoproj/tap\nbrew install argoproj/tap/argocd\n3. Access the Argo CD API server\nBy default, the Argo CD API server is not exposed with an external IP. To access the API server,\nchoose one of the following techniques to expose the Argo CD API server:\nService Type LoadBalancer\nChange the argocd-server service type to LoadBalancer:\nkubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd -p '{\"spec\": {\"type\": \"LoadBalancer\"}}'\nIngress\nFollow the ingress documentation on how to configure Argo CD with ingress.\nPort Forwarding\nKubectl port-forwarding can also be used to connect to the API server without exposing the service.\nkubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443\nThe API server can then be accessed using the localhost:8080\n4. Login using the CLI\nLogin as the admin user. The initial password is autogenerated to be the pod name of the\nArgo CD API server. This can be retrieved with the command:\nkubectl get pods -n argocd -l app.kubernetes.io/name=argocd-server -o name | cut -d'/' -f 2\nUsing the above password, login to Argo CD's IP or hostname:\nargocd login <ARGOCD_SERVER>\nChange the password using the command:\nargocd account update-password\n5. Register a cluster to deploy apps to (optional)\nThis step registers a cluster's credentials to Argo CD, and is only necessary when deploying to\nan external cluster. When deploying internally (to the same cluster that Argo CD is running in),\nhttps://kubernetes.default.svc should be used as the application's K8s API server address.\nFirst list all clusters contexts in your current kubconfig:\nargocd cluster add\nChoose a context name from the list and supply it to argocd cluster add CONTEXTNAME. For example,\nfor docker-for-desktop context, run:\nargocd cluster add docker-for-desktop\nThe above command installs a ServiceAccount (argocd-manager), into the kube-system namespace of \nthat kubectl context, and binds the service account to an admin-level ClusterRole. Argo CD uses this\nservice account token to perform its management tasks (i.e. deploy/monitoring).\n\nNOTE: the rules of the argocd-manager-role role can be modified such that it only has \ncreate, update, patch, delete privileges to a limited set of namespaces, groups, kinds.\nHowever get, list, watch privileges are required at the cluster-scope for Argo CD to function.\n\n6. Create an application from a git repository\nAn example git repository containing a guestbook application is available at\nhttps://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git to demonstrate how Argo CD works.\nCreating apps via CLI\nargocd app create guestbook \\\n  --repo https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git \\\n  --path guestbook \\\n  --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc \\\n  --dest-namespace default\nCreating apps via UI\nOpen a browser to the Argo CD external UI, and login using the credentials, IP/hostname set in step 4.\nConnect the https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git repo to Argo CD:\n\nAfter connecting a git repository, select the guestbook application for creation:\n\n\n7.

This is useful if you:\n\nAre affected by known issues where your Ingress or StatefulSet resources are stuck in Progressing state because of bug in your resource controller.\nHave a custom resource for which Argo CD does not have a built-in health check.\n\nThere are two ways to configure a custom health check. The next two sections describe those ways.\nWay 1. Define a Custom Health Check in argocd-cm ConfigMap\nCustom health checks can be defined in resource.customizations field of argocd-cm. Following example demonstrates a health check for certmanager.k8s.io/Certificate.\ndata:\n  resource.customizations: |\n    certmanager.k8s.io/Certificate:\n      health.lua: |\n        hs = {}\n        if obj.status ~= nil then\n          if obj.status.conditions ~= nil then\n            for i, condition in ipairs(obj.status.conditions) do\n              if condition.type == \"Ready\" and condition.status == \"False\" then\n                hs.status = \"Degraded\"\n                hs.message = condition.message\n                return hs\n              end\n              if condition.type == \"Ready\" and condition.status == \"True\" then\n                hs.status = \"Healthy\"\n                hs.message = condition.message\n                return hs\n              end\n            end\n          end\n        end\n\n        hs.status = \"Progressing\"\n        hs.message = \"Waiting for certificate\"\n        return hs\nThe obj is a global variable which contains the resource. The script must return an object with status and optional message field.\nNOTE: as a security measure you don't have access to most of the standard Lua libraries.\nWay 2. Contribute a Custom Health Check to https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd\nA health check can be bundled into Argo CD. Custom health check scripts are located in the resource_customizations directory. This must have the following directory structure:\nargo-cd\n|-- resource_customizations\n|    |-- your.crd.group.io               # CRD group\n|    |    |-- MyKind                     # Resource kind\n|    |    |    |-- health.lua            # Health check\n|    |    |    |-- health_test.yaml      # Test inputs and expected results\n|    |    |    +-- testdata              # Directory with test resource YAML definitionsEach health check must have tests defined in health_test.yaml file. The health_test.yaml is a YAML file with the following structure:\ntests:\n- healthStatus:\n    status: ExpectedStatus\n    message: Expected message\n  inputPath: testdata/test-resource-definition.yaml\nThe PR#1139 is an example of Cert Manager CRDs custom health check.\n"},"argo-cd/docs/ingress":{"id":"argo-cd/docs/ingress","title":"argo-cd/docs/ingress","body":"Ingress Configuration\nArgo CD runs both a gRPC server (used by the CLI), as well as a HTTP/HTTPS server (used by the UI).\nBoth protocols are exposed by the argocd-server service object on the following ports:\n\n443 - gRPC/HTTPS\n80 - HTTP (redirects to HTTPS)\n\nThere are several ways how Ingress can be configured.\nkubernetes/ingress-nginx\nOption 1: ssl-passthrough\nBecause Argo CD serves multiple protocols (gRPC/HTTPS) on the same port (443), this provides a\nchallenge when attempting to define a single nginx ingress object and rule for the argocd-service,\nsince the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol annotation\naccepts only a single value for the backend protocol (e.g. HTTP, HTTPS, GRPC, GRPCS).\nIn order to expose the Argo CD API server with a single ingress rule and hostname, the\nnginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough annotation\nmust be used to passthrough TLS connections and terminate TLS at the Argo CD API server.\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: argocd-server-ingress\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx\n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: \"true\"\n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: \"true\"\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - host: argocd.example.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - backend:\n          serviceName: argocd-server\n          servicePort: https\nThe above rule terminates TLS at the Argo CD API server, which detects the protocol being used,\nand responds appropriately. Note that the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough annotation\nrequires that the --enable-ssl-passthrough flag be added to the command line arguments to\nnginx-ingress-controller.\nOption 2: Multiple ingress objects and hosts\nSince ingress-nginx Ingress supports only a single protocol per Ingress object, an alternative\nway would be to define two Ingress objects. One for HTTP/HTTPS, and the other for gRPC:\nHTTP/HTTPS Ingress:\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: argocd-server-http-ingress\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: \"nginx\"\n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: \"true\"\n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: \"HTTP\"\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - http:\n      paths:\n      - backend:\n          serviceName: argocd-server\n          servicePort: http\n    host: argocd.example.com\n  tls:\n  - hosts:\n    - argocd.example.com\n    secretName: argocd-secret\ngRPC Ingress:\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: argocd-server-grpc-ingress\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: \"nginx\"\n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: \"GRPC\"\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - http:\n      paths:\n      - backend:\n          serviceName: argocd-server\n          servicePort: https\n    host: grpc.argocd.example.com\n  tls:\n  - hosts:\n    - grpc.argocd.example.com\n    secretName: argocd-secret\nThe API server should then be run with TLS disabled. Edit the argocd-server deployment to add the\n--insecure flag to the argocd-server command:\nspec:\n  template:\n    spec:\n      name: argocd-server\n      containers:\n      - command:\n        - /argocd-server\n        - --staticassets\n        - /shared/app\n        - --repo-server\n        - argocd-repo-server:8081\n        - --insecure\nThe obvious disadvantage to this approach is that this technique require two separate hostnames for\nthe API server -- one for gRPC and the other for HTTP/HTTPS. However it allow TLS termination to\nhappen at the ingress controller.\nAWS Application Load Balancers (ALBs) and Classic ELB (HTTP mode)\nNeither ALBs and Classic ELB in HTTP mode, do not have full support for HTTP2/gRPC which is the\nprotocol used by the argocd CLI. Thus, when using an AWS load balancer, either Classic ELB in\npassthrough mode is needed, or NLBs.\nUI base path\nIf Argo CD UI is available under non-root path (e.g. /argo-cd instead of /) then UI path should be configured in API server.\nTo configure UI path add --basehref flag into argocd-server deployment command:\nspec:\n  template:\n    spec:\n      name: argocd-server\n      containers:\n      - command:\n        - /argocd-server\n        - --staticassets\n        - /shared/app\n        - --repo-server\n        - argocd-repo-server:8081\n        - --basehref\n        - /argo-cd\nNOTE: flag --basehref only changes UI base URL. API server keep using / path so you need to add URL rewrite rule to proxy config.\nExample nginx.conf with URL rewrite:\nworker_processes 1;\n\nevents { worker_connections 1024; }\n\nhttp {\n\n    sendfile on;\n\n    server {\n        listen 443;\n\n        location /argo-cd {\n            rewrite /argo-cd/(.*) /$1  break;\n            proxy_pass         https://localhost:8080;\n            proxy_redirect     off;\n            proxy_set_header   Host $host;\n            proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n            proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n            proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Host $server_name;\n        }\n    }\n}"},"argo-cd/docs/internal/releasing":{"id":"argo-cd/docs/internal/releasing","title":"argo-cd/docs/internal/releasing","body":"Argo CD Release Instructions\n\nTag, build, and push argo-cd-ui\ncd argo-cd-ui\ngit checkout -b release-X.Y\ngit tag vX.Y.Z\ngit push upstream release-X.Y --tags\nIMAGE_NAMESPACE=argoproj IMAGE_TAG=vX.Y.Z DOCKER_PUSH=true yarn docker\n\nCreate release-X.Y branch (if creating initial X.Y release)\ngit checkout -b release-X.Y\ngit push upstream release-X.Y\n\nUpdate VERSION and manifests with new version\nvi VERSION # ensure value is desired X.Y.Z semantic version\nmake manifests IMAGE_TAG=vX.Y.Z\ngit commit -a -m \"Update manifests to vX.Y.Z\"\ngit push upstream release-X.Y\n\nTag, build, and push release to docker hub\ngit tag vX.Y.Z\nmake release IMAGE_NAMESPACE=argoproj IMAGE_TAG=vX.Y.Z DOCKER_PUSH=true\ngit push upstream vX.Y.Z\n\nUpdate argocd brew formula\ngit clone https://github.com/argoproj/homebrew-tap\ncd homebrew-tap\n./update.sh ~/go/src/github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/dist/argocd-darwin-amd64\ngit commit -a -m \"Update argocd to vX.Y.Z\"\ngit push\n\nUpdate documentation:\n\nEdit CHANGELOG.md with release notes\n\nUpdate stable tag\ngit tag stable --force && git push upstream stable --force\nCreate GitHub release from new tag and upload binaries (e.g. dist/argocd-darwin-amd64)\n\n\n"},"argo-cd/docs/metrics":{"id":"argo-cd/docs/metrics","title":"argo-cd/docs/metrics","body":"Prometheus Metrics\nArgo CD exposes two sets of prometheus metrics\nApplication Metrics\nMetrics about applications.

It also serves as an alternative way of \nredeploying an application by changing application parameters via Argo CD, instead of making the \nchanges to the manifests in git.\nNOTE: many consider this mode of operation as an anti-pattern to GitOps, since the source of\ntruth becomes a union of the git repository, and the application overrides. The Argo CD parameter\noverrides feature is provided mainly as a convenience to developers and is intended to be used in\ndev/test environments, vs. production environments.\nTo use parameter overrides, run the argocd app set -p (COMPONENT=)PARAM=VALUE command:\nargocd app set guestbook -p guestbook=image=example/guestbook:abcd123\nargocd app sync guestbookThe PARAM is expected to be a normal YAML path\nargocd app set guestbook -p guestbook=ingress.enabled=true\nargocd app set guestbook -p guestbook=ingress.hosts[0]=guestbook.myclusterurl\nThe following are situations where parameter overrides would be useful:\n\nA team maintains a \"dev\" environment, which needs to be continually updated with the latest\nversion of their guestbook application after every build in the tip of master. To address this use\ncase, the application would expose a parameter named image, whose value used in the dev\nenvironment contains a placeholder value (e.g. example/guestbook:replaceme). The placeholder value\nwould be determined externally (outside of git) such as a build system. Then, as part of the build\npipeline, the parameter value of the image would be continually updated to the freshly built image\n(e.g. argocd app set guestbook -p guestbook=image=example/guestbook:abcd123). A sync operation\nwould result in the application being redeployed with the new image.\n\nA repository of Helm manifests is already publicly available (e.g. https://github.com/helm/charts).\nSince commit access to the repository is unavailable, it is useful to be able to install charts from\nthe public repository and customize the deployment with different parameters, without resorting to\nforking the repository to make the changes. For example, to install Redis from the Helm chart\nrepository and customize the the database password, you would run:\n\n\nargocd app create redis --repo https://github.com/helm/charts.git --path stable/redis --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace default -p password=abc123"},"argo-cd/docs/projects":{"id":"argo-cd/docs/projects","title":"argo-cd/docs/projects","body":"Projects\nProjects provide a logical grouping of applications, which is useful when Argo CD is used by multiple\nteams.

Both team1 and team2 have the ability to manage repositories.\nConfigMap argocd-rbac-cm example:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: argocd-rbac-cm\ndata:\n  policy.default: \"\"\n  policy.csv: |\n    p, some-github-org:team1, applications, *, project-a/*, allow\n    p, some-github-org:team2, applications, *, project-a/*, allow\n\n    p, role:org-admin, repositories, get, *, allow\n    p, role:org-admin, repositories, create, *, allow\n    p, role:org-admin, repositories, update, *, allow\n    p, role:org-admin, repositories, delete, *, allow\n\n    g, some-github-org:team1, org-admin\n    g, some-github-org:team2, org-admin\nProject Roles\nProjects include a feature called roles that enable automated access to a project's applications.\nThese can be used to give a CI pipeline a restricted set of permissions. For example, a CI system\nmay only be able to sync a single app (but not change its source or destination).\nProjects can have multiple roles, and those roles can have different access granted to them. These\npermissions are called policies, and they are stored within the role as a list of policy strings.\nA role's policy can only grant access to that role and are limited to applications within the role's\nproject.  However, the policies have an option for granting wildcard access to any application\nwithin a project.\nIn order to create roles in a project and add policies to a role, a user will need permission to\nupdate a project.  The following commands can be used to manage a role.\nargocd proj role list\nargocd proj role get\nargocd proj role create\nargocd proj role delete\nargocd proj role add-policy\nargocd proj role remove-policy\nProject roles in itself are not useful without generating a token to associate to that role. Argo CD\nsupports JWT tokens as the means to authenticate to a role. Since the JWT token is\nassociated with a role's policies, any changes to the role's policies will immediately take effect\nfor that JWT token.\nThe following commands are used to manage the JWT tokens.\nargocd proj role create-token PROJECT ROLE-NAME\nargocd proj role delete-token PROJECT ROLE-NAME ISSUED-AT\nSince the JWT tokens aren't stored in Argo CD, they can only be retrieved when they are created. A\nuser can leverage them in the cli by either passing them in using the --auth-token flag or setting\nthe ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable. The JWT tokens can be used until they expire or are\nrevoked.  The JWT tokens can created with or without an expiration, but the default on the cli is\ncreates them without an expirations date.  Even if a token has not expired, it cannot be used if\nthe token has been revoked.\nBelow is an example of leveraging a JWT token to access a guestbook application.  It makes the\nassumption that the user already has a project named myproject and an application called\nguestbook-default.\nPROJ=myproject\nAPP=guestbook-default\nROLE=get-role\nargocd proj role create $PROJ $ROLE\nargocd proj role create-token $PROJ $ROLE -e 10m\nJWT=<value from command above>\nargocd proj role list $PROJ\nargocd proj role get $PROJ $ROLE\n\n# This command will fail because the JWT Token associated with the project role does not have a policy to allow access to the application\nargocd app get $APP --auth-token $JWT\n# Adding a policy to grant access to the application for the new role\nargocd proj role add-policy $PROJ $ROLE --action get --permission allow --object $APP\nargocd app get $PROJ-$ROLE --auth-token $JWT\n\n# Removing the policy we added and adding one with a wildcard.\nargocd proj role remove-policy $PROJ $TOKEN -a get -o $PROJ-$TOKEN\nargocd proj role remove-policy $PROJ $TOKEN -a get -o '*'\n# The wildcard allows us to access the application due to the wildcard.\nargocd app get $PROJ-$TOKEN --auth-token $JWT\nargocd proj role get $PROJ\n\n\nargocd proj role get $PROJ $ROLE\n# Revoking the JWT token\nargocd proj role delete-token $PROJ $ROLE <id field from the last command>\n# This will fail since the JWT Token was deleted for the project role.\nargocd app get $APP --auth-token $JWT\n"},"argo-cd/docs/rbac":{"id":"argo-cd/docs/rbac","title":"argo-cd/docs/rbac","body":"RBAC\nOverview\nThe RBAC feature enables restriction of access to Argo CD resources.

Hooks are ways to interject custom logic before, during,\nand after a Sync operation. Some use cases for hooks are:\n\nUsing a PreSync hook to perform a database schema migration before deploying a new version of the app.\nUsing a Sync hook to orchestrate a complex deployment requiring more sophistication than the\nkubernetes rolling update strategy (e.g. a blue/green deployment).\nUsing a PostSync hook to run integration and health checks after a deployment.\n\nUsage\nHooks are simply kubernetes manifests annotated with the argocd.argoproj.io/hook annotation.

Multiple hooks can be specified as a comma\nseparated list.\nAvailable Hooks\nThe following hooks are defined:\n\n\n\nHook\nDescription\n\n\n\nPreSync\nExecutes prior to the apply of the manifests.\n\n\nSync\nExecutes after all PreSync hooks completed and were successful.

The following are some security\ntopics and implementation details of Argo CD.\nAuthentication\nAuthentication to Argo CD API server is performed exclusively using JSON Web Tokens\n(JWTs). Username/password bearer tokens are not used for authentication. The JWT is obtained/managed\nin one of the following ways:\n\nFor the local admin user, a username/password is exchanged for a JWT using the /api/v1/session\nendpoint. This token is signed & issued by the Argo CD API server itself, and has no expiration.\nWhen the admin password is updated, all existing admin JWT tokens are immediately revoked.\nThe password is stored as a bcrypt hash in the argocd-secret Secret.\n\nFor Single Sign-On users, the user completes an OAuth2 login flow to the configured OIDC identity\nprovider (either delegated through the bundled Dex provider, or directly to a self-managed OIDC\nprovider). This JWT is signed & issued by the IDP, and expiration and revokation is handled by\nthe provider. Dex tokens expire after 24 hours.\n\nAutomation tokens are generated for a project using the /api/v1/projects/{project}/roles/{role}/token\nendpoint, and are signed & issued by Argo CD. These tokens are limited in scope and privilege,\nand can only be used to manage application resources in the project which it belongs to. Project\nJWTs have a configurable expiration and can be immediately revoked by deleting the JWT reference\nID from the project role.\n\n\nAuthorization\nAuthorization is performed by iterating the list of group membership in a user's JWT groups claims,\nand comparing each group against the roles/rules in the RBAC policy. Any matched rule\npermits access to the API request.\nTLS\nAll network communication is performed over TLS including service-to-service communication between\nthe three components (argocd-server, argocd-repo-server, argocd-application-controller). The Argo CD\nAPI server can enforce the use of TLS 1.2 using the flag: --tlsminversion 1.2.\nSensitive Information\nSecrets\nArgo CD never returns sensitive data from its API, and redacts all sensitive data in API payloads\nand logs. This includes:\n\ncluster credentials\ngit credentials\nOAuth2 client secrets\nKubernetes Secret values\n\nExternal Cluster Credentials\nTo manage external clusters, Argo CD stores the credentials of the external cluster as a Kubernetes\nSecret in the argocd namespace. This secret contains the K8s API bearer token associated with the\nargocd-manager ServiceAccount created during argocd cluster add, along with connection options\nto that API server (TLS configuration/certs, aws-iam-authenticator RoleARN, etc...).\nThe information is used to reconstruct a REST config and kubeconfig to the cluster used by Argo CD\nservices.\nTo rotate the bearer token used by Argo CD, the token can be deleted (e.g. using kubectl) which\ncauses kuberentes to generate a new secret with a new bearer token. The new token can be re-inputted\nto Argo CD by re-running argocd cluster add. Run the following commands against the managed\ncluster:\n# run using a kubeconfig for the externally managed cluster\nkubectl delete secret argocd-manager-token-XXXXXX -n kube-system\nargocd cluster add CONTEXTNAME\nTo revoke Argo CD's access to a managed cluster, delete the RBAC artifacts against the managed\ncluster, and remove the cluster entry from Argo CD:\n# run using a kubeconfig for the externally managed cluster\nkubectl delete sa argocd-manager -n kube-system \nkubectl delete clusterrole argocd-manager-role\nkubectl delete clusterrolebinding argocd-manager-role-binding\nargocd cluster rm https://your-kubernetes-cluster-addr\n\nNOTE: for AWS EKS clusters, aws-iam-authenticator\n  is used to authenticate to the external cluster, which uses IAM roles in lieu of locally stored\n  tokens, so token rotation is not needed, and revokation is handled through IAM.\n\nCluster RBAC\nBy default, Argo CD uses a clusteradmin level role\nin order to:\n\nwatch & operate on cluster state\ndeploy resources to the cluster\n\nAlthough Argo CD requires cluster-wide read privileges to resources in the managed cluster to\nfunction properly, it does not necessarily need full write privileges to the cluster. The\nClusterRole used by argocd-server and argocd-application-controller can be modified such\nthat write privileges are limited to only the namespaces and resources that you wish Argo CD to\nmanage.\nTo fine-tune privileges of externally managed clusters, edit the ClusterRole of the argocd-manager-role\n# run using a kubeconfig for the externally managed cluster\nkubectl edit clusterrole argocd-manager-role\nTo fine-tune privileges which Argo CD has against its own cluster (i.e. https://kubernetes.default.svc),\nedit the following cluster roles where Argo CD is running in:\n# run using a kubeconfig to the cluster Argo CD is running in\nkubectl edit clusterrole argocd-server\nkubectl edit clusterrole argocd-application-controller\nNote:\n\nIf you to deny ArgoCD access to a kind of resource then add it as an excluded resource. \n\nAuditing\nAs a GitOps deployment tool, the git commit history provides a natural audit log of what changes\nwere made to application configuration, when they were made, and by whom. However, this audit log\nonly applies to what happened in git and does not necessarily correlate one-to-one with events\nthat happen in a cluster. For example, User A could have made multiple commits to application\nmanifests, but User B could have just only synced those changes to the cluster sometime later.\nTo complement the git revision history, Argo CD emits Kubernetes Events of application activity,\nindicating the responsible actor when applicable. For example:\n$ kubectl get events\nLAST SEEN   FIRST SEEN   COUNT   NAME                         KIND          SUBOBJECT   TYPE      REASON               SOURCE                          MESSAGE\n1m          1m           1       guestbook.157f7c5edd33aeac   Application               Normal    ResourceCreated      argocd-server                   admin created application\n1m          1m           1       guestbook.157f7c5f0f747acf   Application               Normal    ResourceUpdated      argocd-application-controller   Updated sync status:  -> OutOfSync\n1m          1m           1       guestbook.157f7c5f0fbebbff   Application               Normal    ResourceUpdated      argocd-application-controller   Updated health status:  -> Missing\n1m          1m           1       guestbook.157f7c6069e14f4d   Application               Normal    OperationStarted     argocd-server                   admin initiated sync to HEAD (8a1cb4a02d3538e54907c827352f66f20c3d7b0d)\n1m          1m           1       guestbook.157f7c60a55a81a8   Application               Normal    OperationCompleted   argocd-application-controller   Sync operation to 8a1cb4a02d3538e54907c827352f66f20c3d7b0d succeeded\n1m          1m           1       guestbook.157f7c60af1ccae2   Application               Normal    ResourceUpdated      argocd-application-controller   Updated sync status: OutOfSync -> Synced\n1m          1m           1       guestbook.157f7c60af5bc4f0   Application               Normal    ResourceUpdated      argocd-application-controller   Updated health status: Missing -> Progressing\n1m          1m           1       guestbook.157f7c651990e848   Application               Normal    ResourceUpdated      argocd-application-controller   Updated health status: Progressing -> Healthy\nThese events can be then be persisted for longer periods of time using other tools as\nEvent Exporter or\nEvent Router.\nWebHook Payloads\nPayloads from webhook events are considered untrusted. Argo CD only examines the payload to infer\nthe involved applications of the webhook event (e.g. which repo was modified), then refreshes\nthe related application for reconciliation. This refresh is the same refresh which occurs regularly\nat three minute intervals, just fast-tracked by the webhook event.\nReporting Vulnerabilities\nPlease report security vulnerabilities by e-mailing:\n\nJesse_Suen@intuit.com\nAlexander_Matyushentsev@intuit.com\nEdward_Lee@intuit.com\n\n"},"argo-cd/docs/sso":{"id":"argo-cd/docs/sso","title":"argo-cd/docs/sso","body":"SSO Configuration\nOverview\nArgo CD does not have any local users other than the built-in admin user.

This document describes the different techniques and the means of deploying those manifests to\nthe target environment.\nHEAD / Branch Tracking\nIf a branch name, or a symbolic reference (like HEAD) is specified, Argo CD will continually compare\nlive state against the resource manifests defined at the tip of the specified branch or the\ndereferenced commit of the symbolic reference.\nTo redeploy an application, a user makes changes to the manifests, and commit/pushes those the\nchanges to the tracked branch/symbolic reference, which will then be detected by Argo CD controller.\nTag Tracking\nIf a tag is specified, the manifests at the specified git tag will be used to perform the sync\ncomparison. This provides some advantages over branch tracking in that a tag is generally considered\nmore stable, and less frequently updated, with some manual judgement of what constitutes a tag.\nTo redeploy an application, the user uses git to change the meaning of a tag by retagging it to a\ndifferent commit SHA. Argo CD will detect the new meaning of the tag when performing the\ncomparison/sync.\nCommit Pinning\nIf a git commit SHA is specified, the application is effectively pinned to the manifests defined at\nthe specified commit. This is the most restrictive of the techniques and is typically used to\ncontrol production environments.\nSince commit SHAs cannot change meaning, the only way to change the live state of an application\nwhich is pinned to a commit, is by updating the tracking revision in the application to a different\ncommit containing the new manifests. Note that parameter overrides can still be set\non an application which is pinned to a revision.\nAutomated Sync\nIn all tracking strategies, the application has the option to sync automatically. If auto-sync\nis configured, the new resources manifests will be applied automatically -- as soon as a difference\nis detected between the target state (git) and live state. If auto-sync is disabled, a manual sync\nwill be needed using the Argo UI, CLI, or API.\nParameter Overrides\nNote that in all tracking strategies, any parameter overrides set in the\napplication instance take precedence over the git state.\n"},"argo-cd/docs/webhook":{"id":"argo-cd/docs/webhook","title":"argo-cd/docs/webhook","body":"Git Webhook Configuration\nOverview\nArgo CD polls git repositories every three minutes to detect changes to the manifests.

The following explains how to configure\na git webhook for GitHub, but the same process should be applicable to other providers.\n1. Create the webhook in the git provider\nIn your git provider, navigate to the settings page where webhooks can be configured.

Further documentation\nis provided for additional features.\nHow it works\nArgo CD follows the GitOps pattern of using git repositories as the source of truth for defining\nthe desired application state. Kubernetes manifests can be specified in several ways:\n\nkustomize applications\nhelm charts\nksonnet applications\njsonnet files \nPlain directory of YAML/json manifests\n\nArgo CD automates the deployment of the desired application states in the specified target environments.\nApplication deployments can track updates to branches, tags, or pinned to a specific version of\nmanifests at a git commit. See tracking strategies for additional\ndetails about the different tracking strategies available.\nFor a quick 10 minute overview of Argo CD, check out the demo presented to the Sig Apps community\nmeeting:\n\nArchitecture\n\nArgo CD is implemented as a kubernetes controller which continuously monitors running applications\nand compares the current, live state against the desired target state (as specified in the git repo).\nA deployed application whose live state deviates from the target state is considered OutOfSync.\nArgo CD reports & visualizes the differences, while providing facilities to automatically or\nmanually sync the live state back to the desired target state. Any modifications made to the desired\ntarget state in the git repo can be automatically applied and reflected in the specified target\nenvironments.\nFor additional details, see architecture overview.\nFeatures\n\nAutomated deployment of applications to specified target environments\nSupport for multiple config management/templating tools (Kustomize, Helm, Ksonnet, Jsonnet, plain-YAML)\nAbility to manage and deploy to multiple clusters\nSSO Integration (OIDC, OAuth2, LDAP, SAML 2.0, GitHub, GitLab, Microsoft, LinkedIn)\nMulti-tenancy and RBAC policies for authorization\nRollback/Roll-anywhere to any application configuration committed in git repository\nHealth status analysis of application resources\nAutomated configuration drift detection and visualization\nAutomated or manual syncing of applications to its desired state\nWeb UI which provides real-time view of application activity\nCLI for automation and CI integration\nWebhook integration (GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab)\nAccess tokens for automation\nPreSync, Sync, PostSync hooks to support complex application rollouts (e.g.blue/green & canary upgrades)\nAudit trails for application events and API calls\nPrometheus metrics\nParameter overrides for overriding ksonnet/helm parameters in git\n\nCommunity Blogs and Presentations\n\nGitOps with Argo CD: Simplify and Automate Deployments Using GitOps with IBM Multicloud Manager\nKubeCon talk: CI/CD in Light Speed with K8s and Argo CD\nKubeCon talk: Machine Learning as Code\nAmong other things, desribes how Kubeflow uses Argo CD to implement GitOPs for ML\n\n\nSIG Apps demo: Argo CD - GitOps Continuous Delivery for Kubernetes\n\nProject Resources\n\nArgo GitHub:  https://github.com/argoproj\nArgo Slack:   click here to join\nArgo website: https://argoproj.github.io/\n\nDevelopment Status\n\nArgo CD is actively developed and is being used in production to deploy SaaS services at Intuit\n\nRoadmap\nv0.12\n\nSupport for custom K8S manifest templating engines\nSupport for custom health assessments (e.g. CRD health)\nImproved prometheus metrics\nHigher availability\nUI improvements\n\n"},"argo-cd/test/e2e/functional/crd-creation/readme":{"id":"argo-cd/test/e2e/functional/crd-creation/readme","title":"argo-cd/test/e2e/functional/crd-creation/readme","body":"argocd app create crd-creation \\\n  --repo https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd.git \\\n  --path test/e2e/functional/crd-creation \\\n  --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc \\\n  --dest-namespace default"},"argo-cd/util/helm/testdata/minio/readme":{"id":"argo-cd/util/helm/testdata/minio/readme","title":"argo-cd/util/helm/testdata/minio/readme","body":"Minio\nMinio is a lightweight, AWS S3 compatible object storage server. It is best suited for storing unstructured data such as photos, videos, log files, backups, VM and container images. Size of an object can range from a few KBs to a maximum of 5TB. Minio server is light enough to be bundled with the application stack, similar to NodeJS, Redis and MySQL.\nMinio supports distributed mode. In distributed mode, you can pool multiple drives (even on different machines) into a single object storage server.\nIntroduction\nThis chart bootstraps Minio deployment on a Kubernetes cluster using the Helm package manager.\nPrerequisites\n\nKubernetes 1.4+ with Beta APIs enabled for default standalone mode.\nKubernetes 1.5+ with Beta APIs enabled to run Minio in distributed mode.\nPV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure.\n\nInstalling the Chart\nInstall this chart using:\n$ helm install stable/minio\nThe command deploys Minio on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The configuration section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.\nRelease name\nAn instance of a chart running in a Kubernetes cluster is called a release. Each release is identified by a unique name within the cluster. Helm automatically assigns a unique release name after installing the chart. You can also set your preferred name by:\n$ helm install --name my-release stable/minio\nAccess and Secret keys\nBy default a pre-generated access and secret key will be used. To override the default keys, pass the access and secret keys as arguments to helm install.\n$ helm install --set accessKey=myaccesskey,secretKey=mysecretkey \\\n    stable/minio\nUpdating Minio configuration via Helm\nConfigMap allows injecting containers with configuration data even while a Helm release is deployed.\nTo update your Minio server configuration while it is deployed in a release, you need to\n\nCheck all the configurable values in the Minio chart using helm inspect values stable/minio.\nOverride the minio_server_config settings in a YAML formatted file, and then pass that file like this helm upgrade -f config.yaml stable/minio.\nRestart the Minio server(s) for the changes to take effect.\n\nYou can also check the history of upgrades to a release using helm history my-release. Replace my-release with the actual release name.\nUninstalling the Chart\nAssuming your release is named as my-release, delete it using the command:\n$ helm delete my-release\nThe command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.\nConfiguration\nThe following table lists the configurable parameters of the Minio chart and their default values.\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\nimage.repository\nImage repository\nminio/minio\n\n\nimage.tag\nMinio image tag.

For example,\n$ helm install --name my-release \\\n  --set persistence.size=100Gi \\\n    stable/minio\nThe above command deploys Minio server with a 100Gi backing persistent volume.\nAlternately, you can provide a YAML file that specifies parameter values while installing the chart. For example,\n$ helm install --name my-release -f values.yaml stable/minio\n\nTip: You can use the default values.yaml\n\nDistributed Minio\nThis chart provisions a Minio server in standalone mode, by default. To provision Minio server in distributed mode, set the mode field to distributed,\n$ helm install --set mode=distributed stable/minio\nThis provisions Minio server in distributed mode with 4 nodes. To change the number of nodes in your distributed Minio server, set the replicas field,\n$ helm install --set mode=distributed,replicas=8 stable/minio\nThis provisions Minio server in distributed mode with 8 nodes. Note that the replicas value should be an integer between 4 and 16 (inclusive).\nStatefulSet limitations applicable to distributed Minio\n\nStatefulSets need persistent storage, so the persistence.enabled flag is ignored when mode is set to distributed.\nWhen uninstalling a distributed Minio release, you'll need to manually delete volumes associated with the StatefulSet.\n\nNAS Gateway\nPrerequisites\nMinio in NAS gateway mode can be used to create multiple Minio instances backed by single PV in ReadWriteMany mode. Currently few Kubernetes volume plugins support ReadWriteMany mode. To deploy Minio NAS gateway with Helm chart you'll need to have a Persistent Volume running with one of the supported volume plugins. This document\noutlines steps to create a NFS PV in Kubernetes cluster.\nProvision NAS Gateway Minio instances\nTo provision Minio servers in NAS gateway mode, set the nasgateway.enabled field to true,\n$ helm install --set nasgateway.enabled=true stable/minio\nThis provisions 4 Minio NAS gateway instances backed by single storage. To change the number of instances in your Minio deployment, set the replicas field,\n$ helm install --set nasgateway.enabled=true,nasgateway.replicas=8 stable/minio\nThis provisions Minio NAS gateway with 8 instances.\nPersistence\nThis chart provisions a PersistentVolumeClaim and mounts corresponding persistent volume to default location /export. You'll need physical storage available in the Kubernetes cluster for this to work. If you'd rather use emptyDir, disable PersistentVolumeClaim by:\n$ helm install --set persistence.enabled=false stable/minio\n\n*\"An emptyDir volume is first created when a Pod is assigned to a Node, and exists as long as that Pod is running on that node. When a Pod is removed from a node for any reason, the data in the emptyDir is deleted forever.\"*\n\nExisting PersistentVolumeClaim\nIf a Persistent Volume Claim already exists, specify it during installation.\n\nCreate the PersistentVolume\nCreate the PersistentVolumeClaim\nInstall the chart\n\n$ helm install --set persistence.existingClaim=PVC_NAME stable/minio\nNetworkPolicy\nTo enable network policy for Minio,\ninstall a networking plugin that implements the Kubernetes\nNetworkPolicy spec,\nand set networkPolicy.enabled to true.\nFor Kubernetes v1.5 & v1.6, you must also turn on NetworkPolicy by setting\nthe DefaultDeny namespace annotation. Note: this will enforce policy for all pods in the namespace:\nkubectl annotate namespace default \"net.beta.kubernetes.io/network-policy={\\\"ingress\\\":{\\\"isolation\\\":\\\"DefaultDeny\\\"}}\"With NetworkPolicy enabled, traffic will be limited to just port 9000.\nFor more precise policy, set networkPolicy.allowExternal=true. This will\nonly allow pods with the generated client label to connect to Minio.\nThis label will be displayed in the output of a successful install.\n"},"argo-cd/util/helm/testdata/redis/readme":{"id":"argo-cd/util/helm/testdata/redis/readme","title":"argo-cd/util/helm/testdata/redis/readme","body":"Redis\nRedis is an advanced key-value cache and store.

Using chart defaults cause pod failure for the Redis pod as it attempts to write to the /bitnami directory. Consider installing Redis with --set persistence.enabled=false. See minikube issue 1990 for more information.\n\nNetworkPolicy\nTo enable network policy for Redis, install\na networking plugin that implements the Kubernetes NetworkPolicy spec,\nand set networkPolicy.enabled to true.\nFor Kubernetes v1.5 & v1.6, you must also turn on NetworkPolicy by setting\nthe DefaultDeny namespace annotation. Note: this will enforce policy for all pods in the namespace:\nkubectl annotate namespace default \"net.beta.kubernetes.io/network-policy={\\\"ingress\\\":{\\\"isolation\\\":\\\"DefaultDeny\\\"}}\"With NetworkPolicy enabled, only pods with the generated client label will be\nable to connect to Redis. This label will be displayed in the output\nafter a successful install.\nPersistence\nThe Bitnami Redis image stores the Redis data and configurations at the /bitnami path of the container.\nBy default, the chart mounts a Persistent Volume at this location. The volume is created using dynamic volume provisioning. If a Persistent Volume Claim already exists, specify it during installation.\nBy default, the chart persists both data and configuration. If you wish to persist only the data directory set persistence.path to /bitnami/redis/data and persistence.subPath to redis/data.\nExisting PersistentVolumeClaim\n\nCreate the PersistentVolume\nCreate the PersistentVolumeClaim\nInstall the chart\n\n$ helm install --set persistence.existingClaim=PVC_NAME stable/redis\nMetrics\nThe chart optionally can start a metrics exporter for prometheus. The metrics endpoint (port 9121) is exposed in the service. Metrics can be scraped from within the cluster using something similar as the described in the example Prometheus scrape configuration.

For example,\n$ helm install --name my-release \\\n  --set wordpressUsername=admin,wordpressPassword=password,mariadb.mariadbRootPassword=secretpassword \\\n    stable/wordpress\nThe above command sets the WordPress administrator account username and password to admin and password respectively. Additionally, it sets the MariaDB root user password to secretpassword.\nAlternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,\n$ helm install --name my-release -f values.yaml stable/wordpress\n\nTip: You can use the default values.yaml\n\nProduction and horizontal scaling\nThe following repo contains the recommended production settings for wordpress capture in an alternative values file. Please read carefully the comments in the values-production.yaml file to set up your environment appropriately.\nTo horizontally scale this chart, first download the values-production.yaml file to your local folder, then:\n$ helm install --name my-release -f ./values-production.yaml stable/wordpress\nNote that values-production.yaml includes a replicaCount of 3, so there will be 3 WordPress pods. As a result, to use the /admin portal and to ensure you can scale wordpress you need to provide a ReadWriteMany PVC, if you don't have a provisioner for this type of storage, we recommend that you install the nfs provisioner and map it to a RWO volume.\n$ helm install stable/nfs-server-provisioner --set persistence.enabled=true,persistence.size=10Gi\n$ helm install --name my-release -f values-production.yaml --set persistence.storageClass=nfs stable/wordpress\nPersistence\nThe Bitnami WordPress image stores the WordPress data and configurations at the /bitnami path of the container.\nPersistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, and minikube.\nSee the Configuration section to configure the PVC or to disable persistence.\nUsing an external database\nSometimes you may want to have Wordpress connect to an external database rather than installing one inside your cluster, e.g. to use a managed database service, or use run a single database server for all your applications. To do this, the chart allows you to specify credentials for an external database under the externalDatabase parameter. You should also disable the MariaDB installation with the mariadb.enabled option. For example:\n$ helm install stable/wordpress \\\n    --set mariadb.enabled=false,externalDatabase.host=myexternalhost,externalDatabase.user=myuser,externalDatabase.password=mypassword,externalDatabase.database=mydatabase,externalDatabase.port=3306\nNote also if you disable MariaDB per above you MUST supply values for the externalDatabase connection.\nIngress\nThis chart provides support for ingress resources. If you have an\ningress controller installed on your cluster, such as nginx-ingress\nor traefik you can utilize\nthe ingress controller to serve your WordPress application.\nTo enable ingress integration, please set ingress.enabled to true\nHosts\nMost likely you will only want to have one hostname that maps to this\nWordPress installation, however, it is possible to have more than one\nhost.  To facilitate this, the ingress.hosts object is an array.\nFor each item, please indicate a name, tls, tlsSecret, and any\nannotations that you may want the ingress controller to know about.\nIndicating TLS will cause WordPress to generate HTTPS URLs, and\nWordPress will be connected to at port 443.  The actual secret that\ntlsSecret references do not have to be generated by this chart.\nHowever, please note that if TLS is enabled, the ingress record will not\nwork until this secret exists.\nFor annotations, please see this document.\nNot all annotations are supported by all ingress controllers, but this\ndocument does a good job of indicating which annotation is supported by\nmany popular ingress controllers.\nTLS Secrets\nThis chart will facilitate the creation of TLS secrets for use with the\ningress controller, however, this is not required.  There are three\ncommon use cases:\n\nhelm generates/manages certificate secrets\nuser generates/manages certificates separately\nan additional tool (like kube-lego)\nmanages the secrets for the application\n\nIn the first two cases, one will need a certificate and a key.  We would\nexpect them to look like this:\n\ncertificate files should look like (and there can be more than one\ncertificate if there is a certificate chain)\n\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIID6TCCAtGgAwIBAgIJAIaCwivkeB5EMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMFYxCzAJBgNV\n...\njScrvkiBO65F46KioCL9h5tDvomdU1aqpI/CBzhvZn1c0ZTf87tGQR8NK7v7\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\nkeys should look like:-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEogIBAAKCAQEAvLYcyu8f3skuRyUgeeNpeDvYBCDcgq+LsWap6zbX5f8oLqp4\n...\nwrj2wDbCDCFmfqnSJ+dKI3vFLlEz44sAV8jX/kd4Y6ZTQhlLbYc=\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n`\n\nIf you are going to use Helm to manage the certificates, please copy\nthese values into the certificate and key values for a given\ningress.secrets entry.\nIf you are going are going to manage TLS secrets outside of Helm, please\nknow that you can create a TLS secret by doing the following:\nkubectl create secret tls wordpress.local-tls --key /path/to/key.key --cert /path/to/cert.crtPlease see this example\nfor more information.\n"},"argo-cd/util/ksonnet/testdata/readme":{"id":"argo-cd/util/ksonnet/testdata/readme","title":"argo-cd/util/ksonnet/testdata/readme","body":"The ksonnet test-app was generated using the following commands\nks init test-app --api-spec=version:v1.8.0\ncd test-app\n# edit app.yaml to use test-namespace and test-env instead of default\nks generate deployed-service demo --image=gcr.io/kuar-demo/kuard-amd64:1 --replicas=2 --type=ClusterIP"},"argo-ci/readme":{"id":"argo-ci/readme","title":"argo-ci/readme","body":"PROJECT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGE\nArgo CI\nArgo CI is a continuous integration and deployment system powered by Argo workflow engine for Kubernetes.

In addition, calendar gateway supports a recurrence field in which to specify special exclusion dates for which this gateway will not produce an event.\n\nWebhooks:\nWebhook gateway exposes REST API endpoints. The request received on these endpoints are treated as events. See Request Methods in RFC7231 to define the HTTP REST endpoint.\n\nKubernetes Resources:\nResource gateway supports watching Kubernetes resources. Users can specify group, version, kind, and filters including prefix of the object name, labels, annotations, and createdBy time.\n\nArtifacts:\nArtifact gateway supports S3 bucket-notifications via Minio.

New gateway contributions are always welcome.\nManaging Event Sources\n\nThe event sources configurations are managed using K8s configmap. Once the gateway resource is created with the configmap reference in it's spec, it starts watching the configmap.\nThe gateway-client sends each event source configuration to gateway-server over gRPC. The gateway-server then parses the configuration to start consuming events from \nexternal event producing entity.\n\nYou can modify K8s configmap containing event sources configurations anytime and gateway-client will intelligently pick new/deleted configurations and send them over to gateway-server to either\nstart or stop the event sources.\n\n\nHow to write a custom gateway?\nTo implement a custom gateway, you need to create a gRPC server and implement the service defined below.\nThe framework code acts as a gRPC client consuming event stream from gateway server.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nProto Definition\n\nThe proto file is located at https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/blob/master/gateways/eventing.proto \n\nIf you choose to implement the gateway in go, then you can find generated client stubs at https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/blob/master/gateways/eventing.pb.go\n\nTo create stubs in other languages, head over to gRPC website https://grpc.io/\n\nService\n```proto\n/**\n\nService for handling event sources.\n*/\nservice Eventing {\n  // StartEventSource starts an event source and returns stream of events.\n  rpc StartEventSource(EventSource) returns (stream Event);\n  // ValidateEventSource validates an event source.\n  rpc ValidateEventSource(EventSource) returns (ValidEventSource);\n}\n```\n\n\n\nAvailable Environment Variables to Server\n |  Field               |  Description |\n |----------------------|--------------|\n |  GATEWAY_NAMESPACE                           | K8s namespace of the gateway |\n |  GATEWAY_EVENT_SOURCE_CONFIG_MAP            | K8s configmap containing event source|\n |  GATEWAY_NAME                               | name of the gateway |\n |  GATEWAY_CONTROLLER_INSTANCE_ID             | gateway controller instance id |\n | GATEWAY_CONTROLLER_NAME                     | gateway controller name\n | GATEWAY_SERVER_PORT                         | Port on which the gateway gRPC server should run \n\nImplementation\nYou can follow existing implementations here\n\n\nExamples\nYou can find gateway examples here\n"},"argo-events/docs/gateway-protocol":{"id":"argo-events/docs/gateway-protocol","title":"argo-events/docs/gateway-protocol","body":"Protocol Documentation\n\nTable of Contents\n\ngithub.com/argoproj/argo-events/pkg/apis/gateway/v1alpha1/generated.proto\nGateway\nGatewayList\nGatewayNotificationWatcher\nGatewaySpec\nGatewayStatus\nGatewayStatus.NodesEntry\nNodeStatus\nNotificationWatchers\nSensorNotificationWatcher\n\n\n\n\nScalar Value Types\n\n\nTop\n\ngithub.com/argoproj/argo-events/pkg/apis/gateway/v1alpha1/generated.proto\n\nGateway\nGateway is the definition of a gateway resource\n+genclient\n+k8s:deepcopy-gen:interfaces=k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime.Object\n+k8s:openapi-gen=true\n\n\n\nField\nType\nLabel\nDescription\n\n\n\nmetadata\nk8s.io.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ObjectMeta\noptional\n\n\n\nstatus\nGatewayStatus\noptional\n\n\n\nspec\nGatewaySpec\noptional\n\n\n\n\nGatewayList\nGatewayList is the list of Gateway resources\n+k8s:deepcopy-gen:interfaces=k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime.Object\n\n\n\nField\nType\nLabel\nDescription\n\n\n\nmetadata\nk8s.io.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ListMeta\noptional\n\n\n\nitems\nGateway\nrepeated\n\n\n\n\nGatewayNotificationWatcher\nGatewayNotificationWatcher is the gateway interested in listening to notifications from this gateway\n\n\n\nField\nType\nLabel\nDescription\n\n\n\nname\nstring\noptional\nName is the gateway name\n\n\nport\nstring\noptional\nPort is http server port on which gateway is running\n\n\nendpoint\nstring\noptional\nEndpoint is REST API endpoint to post event to.

It is defined as \"gateway-name:event-source-name\".\n\nWhat is a dependency group?\nA dependency group is basically a group of event dependencies.\n\nWhat is a circuit?\nCircuit is any arbitrary boolean logic that can be applied on dependency groups.\n\nWhat is a trigger?\nRefer Triggers.\n\n\nHow it works?\n\nOnce the sensor receives an event from gateway either over HTTP or through NATS, it validates\nthe event against dependencies defined in sensor spec. If the event is expected, then it is marked as a valid\nevent and the dependency is marked as resolved.\n\nIf you haven't defined dependency groups, sensor basically waits for all dependencies to resolve\nand then kicks off triggers in sequence. If filters are defined, sensor applies the filter on target event \nand if events pass the filters, triggers are fired.\n\nIf you have defined dependency groups, sensor upon receiving an event evaluates the group to which the event belongs to\nand marks the group as resolved if all other event dependencies in the group are already resolved.\n\nWhenever a dependency group is resolved, sensor evaluates the circuit defined in spec. If the circuit resolves to true, the\ntriggers are fired. Sensor always waits for circuit to resolve to true before firing triggers.\n\nYou may not want to fire all the triggers defined in sensor spec. For that, sensor offers when switch on triggers. Basically when switch is way to control when to fire certain trigger depending upon which dependency group is resolved. \n\nAfter sensor fires triggers, it transitions into complete state, increments completion counter and initializes it's state back to running and start the process all over again. Any event that is received in-between are stored on the internal queue.\nNote: If you don't provide dependency groups and circuit, sensor performs an AND operation on event dependencies.\n\n\nFilters\nThere are 3 types of filters that you can apply on event payload:\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\nTime\nFilters the signal based on time constraints\n\n\nEventContext\nFilters metadata that provides circumstantial information about the signal.\n\n\nData\nDescribes constraints and filters for payload\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Filter\n filters:\n         time:\n           start: \"2016-05-10T15:04:05Z07:00\"\n           stop: \"2020-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00\" Example\n\nEventContext Filter\n filters:\n         context:\n             source:\n                 host: amazon.com\n             contentType: application/json Example\n\nData filter\n filters:\n         data:\n             - path: bucket\n               type: string\n               value: argo-workflow-input Example\n\n\nHow to pass an event payload to a trigger?\nPayload of an event can be passed to any trigger. The way it works is you define parameters on trigger resource in sensor spec. \nThe parameters define list of  \n\nsrc -\nevent: the name of the event dependency\npath: which is basically a key within event payload to look for\nvalue: which is a default value if sensor can't find path in event payload.   \n\n\ndest: destination key within trigger spec whose corresponding value needs to be replaced with value from event payload\n\n\nPass complete event payload to trigger example\nExtract particular value from event payload and pass to trigger example \n\nExamples\nYou can find sensor examples here\n"},"argo-events/docs/sensor-protocol":{"id":"argo-events/docs/sensor-protocol","title":"argo-events/docs/sensor-protocol","body":"Protocol Documentation\n\nTable of Contents\n\ngithub.com/argoproj/argo-events/pkg/apis/sensor/v1alpha1/generated.proto\nArtifactLocation\nConfigmapArtifact\nDataFilter\nDependencyGroup\nEventDependency\nEventDependencyFilter\nFileArtifact\nGroupVersionKind\nNodeStatus\nResourceObject\nResourceObject.LabelsEntry\nResourceParameter\nResourceParameterSource\nRetryStrategy\nSensor\nSensorList\nSensorSpec\nSensorStatus\nSensorStatus.NodesEntry\nTimeFilter\nTrigger\nTriggerCondition\nURLArtifact\n\n\n\n\nScalar Value Types\n\n\nTop\n\ngithub.com/argoproj/argo-events/pkg/apis/sensor/v1alpha1/generated.proto\n\nArtifactLocation\nArtifactLocation describes the source location for an external artifact\n\n\n\nField\nType\nLabel\nDescription\n\n\n\ns3\ngithub.com.argoproj.argo_events.pkg.apis.common.S3Artifact\noptional\n\n\n\ninline\nstring\noptional\n\n\n\nfile\nFileArtifact\noptional\n\n\n\nurl\nURLArtifact\noptional\n\n\n\nconfigmap\nConfigmapArtifact\noptional\n\n\n\n\nConfigmapArtifact\nConfigmapArtifact contains information about artifact in k8 configmap\n\n\n\nField\nType\nLabel\nDescription\n\n\n\nname\nstring\noptional\nName of the configmap\n\n\nnamespace\nstring\noptional\nNamespace where configmap is deployed\n\n\nkey\nstring\noptional\nKey within configmap data which contains trigger resource definition\n\n\n\nDataFilter\nDataFilter describes constraints and filters for event data\nRegular Expressions are purposefully not a feature as they are overkill for our uses here\nSee Rob Pike's Post: https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2011/08/regular-expressions-in-lexing-and.html\n\n\n\nField\nType\nLabel\nDescription\n\n\n\npath\nstring\noptional\nPath is the JSONPath of the event's (JSON decoded) data key Path is a series of keys separated by a dot.

Any K8s resource can act as a trigger (Custom Resources included). \nHow to define a trigger?\nThe resource field in the trigger object has details of what to execute when the event dependencies have been resolved. \nThe framework provides support to fetch trigger resources from different sources.\n\nInline\n   Inlined artifacts are included directly within the sensor resource and decoded as a string.\n   Example\n\nS3\n   Argo Events uses the minio-go client for access to any Amazon S3 compatible object store.\n   Example\n\nFile\n   Artifacts are defined in a file that is mounted via a PersistentVolume within the sensor-controller pod.\n   Example\n\nURL\n   Artifacts are accessed from web via RESTful API.\n   Example\n\nConfigmap\n   Artifact stored in Kubernetes configmap are accessed using the key.\n   Example\n\nGit\n   Artifact stored in either public or private Git repository\n   Example\n\n\nWhat resource types are supported out of box?\n\nArgo Workflow\n\nStandard K8s resources\n\nGateway\n\nSensor\n\nTrigger Standard Kubernetes Resource\nThere could be a case where you may want to trigger a standard Kubernetes resource like Pod, Deployment etc. instead of an Argo Workflow.\nThe sensor allows you to trigger any K8s resource in the same way you would trigger an Argo Workflow.\n\nThe example showcases how you can trigger different standard K8s resources.\nYou can find K8s API reference here.\n\nTo trigger other standard K8s resources, change the group and version in triggers/resource accordingly.\n\n\n\nTrigger Gateway\nFollow the example to trigger a gateway. \nIn the example, the sensor creates a configmap and gateway resource for artifact gateway.\nBecause a gateway depends on gateway-configmap which stores the event source configurations, the first trigger in sensor is a configmap\nand the second trigger is actual gateway.\n\nHow to pass the event payload to triggers other than Argo Workflow?\nSame way you would pass an event payload to an Argo Workflow trigger. Refer here\n\n\n\n\nHow can I add my custom resource as trigger?\nThe set of currently supported resources are implemented in the store package. \nYou need to register your custom resource in order for sensor to be able to  trigger it. Once you register your custom resource, you'll need to rebuild the sensor image. \nFollow these steps,\n\nGo to store.go in store package.\nImport your custom resource api package.\nIn init method, add the scheme to your custom resource api.\nMake sure there are no errors.\nRebuild the sensor binary using make sensor\nTo build the image, first change IMAGE_NAMESPACE in Makefile to your docker registry and then run make sensor-image.\n\n"},"argo-events/gateways/core/artifact/install":{"id":"argo-events/gateways/core/artifact/install","title":"argo-events/gateways/core/artifact/install","body":"Artifact Gateway & Sensor\nMinio bucket notifications acts as event sources for artifact gateway.

AWS access keys have the same permissions as the user they are associated with. In particular, you cannot create access keys with reduced scope. If you want to limit the permissions for an access key, you will need to create a user with just the permissions you want to associate with the access key. Otherwise, you can just create an access key using your existing user account.\n$ export mybucket=bucket249\n$ cat > policy.json <<EOF\n{\n   \"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\n   \"Statement\":[\n      {\n         \"Effect\":\"Allow\",\n         \"Action\":[\n            \"s3:PutObject\",\n            \"s3:GetObject\"\n         ],\n         \"Resource\":\"arn:aws:s3:::$mybucket/*\"\n      }\n   ]\n}\nEOF\n$ aws s3 mb s3://$mybucket [--region xxx]\n$ aws iam create-user --user-name $mybucket-user\n$ aws iam put-user-policy --user-name $mybucket-user --policy-name $mybucket-policy --policy-document file://policy.json\n$ aws iam create-access-key --user-name $mybucket-user > access-key.jsonNOTE: if you want argo to figure out which region your buckets belong in, you must additionally set the following statement policy.

The secret is expected to have have the keys 'accessKey' and 'secretKey', containing the base64 encoded credentials to the bucket.\nFor AWS, the accessKeySecret and secretKeySecret correspond to AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY respectively.\nEC2 provides a metadata API via which applications using the AWS SDK may assume IAM roles associated with the instance. If you are running argo on EC2 and the instance role allows access to your S3 bucket, you can configure the workflow step pods to assume the role. To do so, simply omit the accessKeySecret and secretKeySecret fields.\nFor GCS, the accessKeySecret and secretKeySecret for S3 compatible access can be obtained from the GCP Console. Note that S3 compatible access is on a per project rather than per bucket basis.\n\nNavigate to Storage > Settings (https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/settings).\nEnable interoperability access if needed.\nCreate a new key if needed.\n\nFor Minio, the accessKeySecret and secretKeySecret naturally correspond the AccessKey and SecretKey.\nExample:\n$ kubectl edit configmap workflow-controller-configmap -n argo        # assumes argo was installed in the argo namespace\n...\ndata:\n  config: |\n    artifactRepository:\n      s3:\n        bucket: my-bucket\n        keyPrefix: prefix/in/bucket     #optional\n        endpoint: my-minio-endpoint.default:9000        #AWS => s3.amazonaws.com; GCS => storage.googleapis.com\n        insecure: true                  #omit for S3/GCS. Needed when minio runs without TLS\n        accessKeySecret:                #omit if accessing via AWS IAM\n          name: my-minio-cred\n          key: accesskey\n        secretKeySecret:                #omit if accessing via AWS IAM\n          name: my-minio-cred\n          key: secretkeyThe secrets are retrieve from the namespace you use to run your workflows. Note that you can specify a keyPrefix.\nAccessing Non-Default Artifact Repositories\nThis section shows how to access artifacts from non-default artifact repositories.\nThe endpoint, accessKeySecret and secretKeySecret are the same as for configuring the default artifact repository described previously.\n  templates:\n  - name: artifact-example\n    inputs:\n      artifacts:\n      - name: my-input-artifact\n        path: /my-input-artifact\n        s3:\n          endpoint: s3.amazonaws.com\n          bucket: my-aws-bucket-name\n          key: path/in/bucket/my-input-artifact.tgz\n          accessKeySecret:\n            name: my-aws-s3-credentials\n            key: accessKey\n          secretKeySecret:\n            name: my-aws-s3-credentials\n            key: secretKey\n    outputs:\n      artifacts:\n      - name: my-output-artifact\n        path: /my-ouput-artifact\n        s3:\n          endpoint: storage.googleapis.com\n          bucket: my-aws-bucket-name\n          # NOTE that all output artifacts are automatically tarred and\n          # gzipped before saving. So as a best practice, .tgz or .tar.gz\n          # should be incorporated into the key name so the resulting file\n          # has an accurate file extension.\n          key: path/in/bucket/my-output-artifact.tgz\n          accessKeySecret:\n            name: my-gcs-s3-credentials\n            key: accessKey\n          secretKeySecret:\n            name: my-gcs-s3-credentials\n            key: secretKey\n    container:\n      image: debian:latest\n      command: [sh, -c]\n      args: [\"cp -r /my-input-artifact /my-output-artifact\"]"},"argo/branding assets":{"id":"argo/branding assets","title":"argo/branding assets","body":"Argo Branding Assets\nLogo\n\n"},"argo/changelog":{"id":"argo/changelog","title":"argo/changelog","body":"Changelog\n2.2.1 (2018-10-18)\nChangelog since v2.2.0\n\nUI retrieve logs from artifacts location if logs archiving is enabled (issue #1018)\nAdd imagePullPolicy config for executors (@dtaniwaki)\nDetect and indicate when container was OOMKilled\nsupport force namespace isolation in UI\nWorkflow executor panic: workflows.argoproj.io/template not found (issue #1033)\ngc-ttl dose not work (issue #1004)\nResubmission of a terminated workflow creates a new workflow that is already terminated (issue #1011)\nZIP containing single file cannot be used as an artifact due to errors in init container (issue #984) (@mthx)\nRegression when S3 secret has trailing newline (issue #981)\nDocumentation fixes (@gsf, @davidB, @dtaniwaki)\n\n2.2.0 (2018-08-30)\nNotes about upgrading from v2.1\n\nThe argo install and argo uninstall commands have been removed from the CLI. Instead, plain\nkubernetes manifests are provided to be installed using kubectl apply, or downstreamed into other\ntools (e.g. helm chart, ksonnet prototype, kustomize, etc...).\n\nIn 2.1, argo would install into the kube-system namespace by default. The new install instructions\nhave been updated to install into a different namespace, argo. In order to move to the recommended\ninstallation location, you should delete the v2.1 resources from kube-system before applying the\nnew manifests to the argo namespace.\n  The following commands migrates the workflow-controller-configmap from the kube-system to the\nargo namespace, and deletes all argo resources from the kube-system namespace. Note that this\nwill delete the argo-ui service, resulting in the LoadBalancer being deleted (if created).\n  kubectl get cm workflow-controller-configmap -o yaml -n kube-system --export | kubectl apply -n argo -f -\n  kubectl delete -n kube-system cm workflow-controller-configmap\n  kubectl delete -n kube-system deploy workflow-controller argo-ui\n  kubectl delete -n kube-system sa argo argo-ui\n  kubectl delete -n kube-system svc argo-ui\nIn 2.1, the argoexec sidecar image was configured in the workflow-controller-configmap. This is\nnow configured using a new --executor-image flag in the workflow-controller deployment. This is\nthe preferred way to configure the executor image, since upgrades can now be performed without\nchanging the workflow-controller configmap. The executorImage setting in the config is deprecated\nand may be removed/ignored in a future release.\n\n\nChangelog since v2.1\n\nSupport withItems/withParam and parameter aggregation with DAG templates (issue #801)\nAdd ability to aggregate and reference output parameters expanded by loops (issue #861)\nSupport for sophisticated expressions in when conditionals (issue #860)\nIntroduce Pending node state to highlight failures when starting workflow pods (issue #525)\nSupport additional container runtimes through kubelet executor (issue #902) (@JulienBalestra)\nIntroduce archive strategies with ability to disable tar.gz archiving (issue #784)\nIntroduce keyFormat workflow config to enable flexibility in archive location path (issue #953)\nIntroduce argo watch command to watch live workflows from terminal (issue #969)\nAdd ability to archive container logs to the artifact repository (issue #454)\nSupport for workflow level timeouts (issue #848)\nIntroduce argo terminate to terminate a workflow without deleting it (issue #527)\nIntroduce withSequence to iterate a range of numbers in a loop (issue #945)\nGithub login using go-git, with support for ssh keys (issue #793) (@andreimc)\nAdd TTLSecondsAfterFinished field and controller to garbage collect completed workflows (issue #911)\nAdd argo delete --older flag to delete completed workflows older than a duration\nSupport referencing of global workflow artifacts (issue #900)\nSupport submission of workflows from json files (issue #926)\nSupport submission of workflows from stdin (issue #926)\nPrometheus metrics and telemetry (issue #896) (@bbc88ks)\nDetect and fail upon unknown fields during argo submit & lint (issue #892)\nAllow scaling of workflow and pod workers via controller CLI flags (issue #962)\nAllow supplying of parameters from a file during argo submit (issue #796) (@vosmith)\n[UI] UI support/spinning clock for pending pods (@EdanSneh)\nRemove installer/uninstaller (issue #928)\nUpdate golang compiler to v1.10.3\nUpdate k8s dependencies to v1.10 and client-go to v7.0\nUpdate argo-cluster-role to work with OpenShift\nFix issue where retryStrategy with DAGs fails, even if the step passes after retries (issue #885)\nFix issue where sidecars and daemons were not reliably killed (issue #879)\nRedundant verifyResolvedVariables check in controller precluded the ability to use {{ }} in other circumstances\nFix issue where retryStrategy with DAGs fails, even if the step passes after retries (issue #885)\nFix outbound node metadata with steps templates causing incorrect edges to be rendered in UI\nFix outbound node metadata with retry nodes causing disconnected nodes to be rendered in UI (issue #880)\nError workflows which hit k8s/etcd 1M resource size limit (issue #913)\n[UI] Fixed 'X' hiding under page (@EdanSneh)\n[UI] Beautified resource template.

Here are the requirements and steps to run the workflows.\nRequirements\n\nInstalled Kubernetes 1.9 or later\nInstalled kubectl\nHave a kubeconfig file (default location is ~/.kube/config).\n\n1. Download Argo\nOn Mac:\nbrew install argoproj/tap/argoOn Linux:\ncurl -sSL -o /usr/local/bin/argo https://github.com/argoproj/argo/releases/download/v2.2.1/argo-linux-amd64\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/argo2. Install the Controller and UI\nkubectl create ns argo\nkubectl apply -n argo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo/v2.2.1/manifests/install.yamlNOTE: On GKE, you may need to grant your account the ability to create new clusterroles\nkubectl create clusterrolebinding YOURNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUREMAIL@gmail.com3. Configure the service account to run workflows\nTo run all of the examples in this guide, the 'default' service account is too limited to support\nfeatures such as artifacts, outputs, access to secrets, etc... For demo purposes, run the following\ncommand to grant admin privileges to the 'default' service account in the namespace 'default':\nkubectl create rolebinding default-admin --clusterrole=admin --serviceaccount=default:defaultFor the bare minimum set of privileges which a workflow needs to function, see\nWorkflow RBAC. You can also submit workflows which run with a different\nservice account using:\nargo submit --serviceaccount <name>4. Run Simple Example Workflows\nargo submit --watch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo/master/examples/hello-world.yaml\nargo submit --watch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo/master/examples/coinflip.yaml\nargo submit --watch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo/master/examples/loops-maps.yaml\nargo list\nargo get xxx-workflow-name-xxx\nargo logs xxx-pod-name-xxx #from get command aboveYou can also create workflows directly with kubectl. However, the Argo CLI offers extra features\nthat kubectl does not, such as YAML validation, workflow visualization, parameter passing, retries\nand resubmits, suspend and resume, and more.\nkubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo/master/examples/hello-world.yaml\nkubectl get wf\nkubectl get wf hello-world-xxx\nkubectl get po --selector=workflows.argoproj.io/workflow=hello-world-xxx --show-all\nkubectl logs hello-world-yyy -c mainAdditional examples are available here.\n5. Install an Artifact Repository\nArgo supports S3 (AWS, GCS, Minio) as well as Artifactory as artifact repositories. This tutorial\nuses Minio for the sake of portability. Instructions on how to configure other artifact repositories\nare here.\nbrew install kubernetes-helm # mac\nhelm init\nhelm install stable/minio --name argo-artifacts --set service.type=LoadBalancer --set persistence.enabled=falseLogin to the Minio UI using a web browser (port 9000) after exposing obtaining the external IP using kubectl.\nkubectl get service argo-artifacts -o wideOn Minikube:\nminikube service --url argo-artifactsNOTE: When minio is installed via Helm, it uses the following hard-wired default credentials,\nwhich you will use to login to the UI:\n\nAccessKey: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\nSecretKey: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\n\nCreate a bucket named my-bucket from the Minio UI.\n6. Reconfigure the workflow controller to use the Minio artifact repository\nEdit the workflow-controller config map to reference the service name (argo-artifacts) and\nsecret (argo-artifacts) created by the helm install:\nkubectl edit cm -n argo workflow-controller-configmap\n...\ndata:\n  config: |\n    artifactRepository:\n      s3:\n        bucket: my-bucket\n        endpoint: argo-artifacts.default:9000\n        insecure: true\n        # accessKeySecret and secretKeySecret are secret selectors.\n        # It references the k8s secret named 'argo-artifacts'\n        # which was created during the minio helm install. The keys,\n        # 'accesskey' and 'secretkey', inside that secret are where the\n        # actual minio credentials are stored.\n        accessKeySecret:\n          name: argo-artifacts\n          key: accesskey\n        secretKeySecret:\n          name: argo-artifacts\n          key: secretkeyNOTE: the Minio secret is retrieved from the namespace you use to run workflows. If Minio is\ninstalled in a different namespace then you will need to create a copy of its secret in the\nnamespace you use for workflows.\n7.

When CRDs are\nregistered in a cluster, access to those resources are made available by exposing new endpoints in\nthe kubernetes API server. For example, to list workflows in the default namespace, a client would\nmake an HTTP GET request to: https://<k8s-api-server>/apis/argoproj.io/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/workflows\n\nNOTE: the optional argo-ui does run a thin API layer to power the UI, but is not intended for\n  programatic interaction.\n\nA common scenario is to programatically submit and retrieve workflows.

Each step in an Argo workflow is defined as a container.\nArgo is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition). As a result, Argo workflows can be managed using kubectl and natively integrates with other Kubernetes services such as volumes, secrets, and RBAC. The new Argo software is light-weight and installs in under a minute, and provides complete workflow features including parameter substitution, artifacts, fixtures, loops and recursive workflows.\nMany of the Argo examples used in this walkthrough are available at https://github.com/argoproj/argo/tree/master/examples.

The above spec contains a single template called whalesay which runs the docker/whalesay container and invokes cowsay \"hello world\". The whalesay template is the entrypoint for the spec. The entrypoint specifies the initial template that should be invoked when the workflow spec is executed by Kubernetes. Being able to specify the entrypoint is more useful when there is more than one template defined in the Kubernetes workflow spec. :-)\nParameters\nLet's look at a slightly more complex workflow spec with parameters.\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  generateName: hello-world-parameters-\nspec:\n  # invoke the whalesay template with\n  # \"hello world\" as the argument\n  # to the message parameter\n  entrypoint: whalesay\n  arguments:\n    parameters:\n    - name: message\n      value: hello world\n\n  templates:\n  - name: whalesay\n    inputs:\n      parameters:\n      - name: message       # parameter declaration\n    container:\n      # run cowsay with that message input parameter as args\n      image: docker/whalesay\n      command: [cowsay]\n      args: [\"{{inputs.parameters.message}}\"]\nThis time, the whalesay template takes an input parameter named message that is passed as the args to the cowsay command. In order to reference parameters (e.g., \"{{inputs.parameters.message}}\"), the parameters must be enclosed in double quotes to escape the curly braces in YAML.\nThe argo CLI provides a convenient way to override parameters used to invoke the entrypoint. For example, the following command would bind the message parameter to \"goodbye world\" instead of the default \"hello world\".\nargo submit arguments-parameters.yaml -p message=\"goodbye world\"\nIn case of multiple parameters that can be overriten, the argo CLI provides a command to load parameters files in YAML or JSON format. Here is an example of that kind of parameter file:\nmessage: goodbye world\nTo run use following command:\nargo submit arguments-parameters.yaml --parameter-file params.yaml\nCommand-line parameters can also be used to override the default entrypoint and invoke any template in the workflow spec. For example, if you add a new version of the whalesay template called whalesay-caps but you don't want to change the default entrypoint, you can invoke this from the command line as follows:\nargo submit arguments-parameters.yaml --entrypoint whalesay-caps\nBy using a combination of the --entrypoint and -p parameters, you can call any template in the workflow spec with any parameter that you like.\nThe values set in the spec.arguments.parameters are globally scoped and can be accessed via {{workflow.parameters.parameter_name}}. This can be useful to pass information to multiple steps in a workflow. For example, if you wanted to run your workflows with different logging levels that are set in the environment of each container, you could have a YAML file similar to this one:\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  generateName: global-parameters-\nspec:\n  entrypoint: A\n  arguments:\n    parameters:\n    - name: log-level\n      value: INFO\n\n  templates:\n  - name: A\n    container:\n      image: containerA\n      env:\n      - name: LOG_LEVEL\n        value: \"{{workflow.parameters.log-level}}\"\n      command: [runA]\n  - name: B\n    container:\n      image: containerB\n      env:\n      - name: LOG_LEVEL\n        value: \"{{workflow.parameters.log-level}}\"\n      command: [runB]\nIn this workflow, both steps A and B would have the same log-level set to INFO and can easily be changed between workflow submissions using the -p flag.\nSteps\nIn this example, we'll see how to create multi-step workflows, how to define more than one template in a workflow spec, and how to create nested workflows. Be sure to read the comments as they provide useful explanations.\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  generateName: steps-\nspec:\n  entrypoint: hello-hello-hello\n\n  # This spec contains two templates: hello-hello-hello and whalesay\n  templates:\n  - name: hello-hello-hello\n    # Instead of just running a container\n    # This template has a sequence of steps\n    steps:\n    - - name: hello1            # hello1 is run before the following steps\n        template: whalesay\n        arguments:\n          parameters:\n          - name: message\n            value: \"hello1\"\n    - - name: hello2a           # double dash => run after previous step\n        template: whalesay\n        arguments:\n          parameters:\n          - name: message\n            value: \"hello2a\"\n      - name: hello2b           # single dash => run in parallel with previous step\n        template: whalesay\n        arguments:\n          parameters:\n          - name: message\n            value: \"hello2b\"\n\n  # This is the same template as from the previous example\n  - name: whalesay\n    inputs:\n      parameters:\n      - name: message\n    container:\n      image: docker/whalesay\n      command: [cowsay]\n      args: [\"{{inputs.parameters.message}}\"]\nThe above workflow spec prints three different flavors of \"hello\". The hello-hello-hello template consists of three steps. The first step named hello1 will be run in sequence whereas the next two steps named hello2a and hello2b will be run in parallel with each other. Using the argo CLI command, we can graphically display the execution history of this workflow spec, which shows that the steps named hello2a and hello2b ran in parallel with each other.\nSTEP                                     PODNAME\n ✔ arguments-parameters-rbm92\n ├---✔ hello1                   steps-rbm92-2023062412\n └-·-✔ hello2a                  steps-rbm92-685171357\n   └-✔ hello2b                  steps-rbm92-634838500DAG\nAs an alternative to specifying sequences of steps, you can define the workflow as a directed-acyclic graph (DAG) by specifying the dependencies of each task. This can be simpler to maintain for complex workflows and allows for maximum parallelism when running tasks.\nIn the following workflow, step A runs first, as it has no dependencies. Once A has finished, steps B and C run in parallel. Finally, once B and C have completed, step D can run.\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  generateName: dag-diamond-\nspec:\n  entrypoint: diamond\n  templates:\n  - name: echo\n    inputs:\n      parameters:\n      - name: message\n    container:\n      image: alpine:3.7\n      command: [echo, \"{{inputs.parameters.message}}\"]\n  - name: diamond\n    dag:\n      tasks:\n      - name: A\n        template: echo\n        arguments:\n          parameters: [{name: message, value: A}]\n      - name: B\n        dependencies: [A]\n        template: echo\n        arguments:\n          parameters: [{name: message, value: B}]\n      - name: C\n        dependencies: [A]\n        template: echo\n        arguments:\n          parameters: [{name: message, value: C}]\n      - name: D\n        dependencies: [B, C]\n        template: echo\n        arguments:\n          parameters: [{name: message, value: D}]\nThe dependency graph may have multiple roots. The templates called from a DAG or steps template can themselves be DAG or steps templates. This can allow for complex workflows to be split into manageable pieces.\nArtifacts\nNote:\nYou will need to configure an artifact repository to run this example.\nConfiguring an artifact repository here.\nWhen running workflows, it is very common to have steps that generate or consume artifacts. Often, the output artifacts of one step may be used as input artifacts to a subsequent step.\nThe below workflow spec consists of two steps that run in sequence. The first step named generate-artifact will generate an artifact using the whalesay template that will be consumed by the second step named print-message that then consumes the generated artifact.\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  generateName: artifact-passing-\nspec:\n  entrypoint: artifact-example\n  templates:\n  - name: artifact-example\n    steps:\n    - - name: generate-artifact\n        template: whalesay\n    - - name: consume-artifact\n        template: print-message\n        arguments:\n          artifacts:\n          # bind message to the hello-art artifact\n          # generated by the generate-artifact step\n          - name: message\n            from: \"{{steps.generate-artifact.outputs.artifacts.hello-art}}\"\n\n  - name: whalesay\n    container:\n      image: docker/whalesay:latest\n      command: [sh, -c]\n      args: [\"cowsay hello world | tee /tmp/hello_world.txt\"]\n    outputs:\n      artifacts:\n      # generate hello-art artifact from /tmp/hello_world.txt\n      # artifacts can be directories as well as files\n      - name: hello-art\n        path: /tmp/hello_world.txt\n\n  - name: print-message\n    inputs:\n      artifacts:\n      # unpack the message input artifact\n      # and put it at /tmp/message\n      - name: message\n        path: /tmp/message\n    container:\n      image: alpine:latest\n      command: [sh, -c]\n      args: [\"cat /tmp/message\"]\nThe whalesay template uses the cowsay command to generate a file named /tmp/hello-world.txt. It then outputs this file as an artifact named hello-art. In general, the artifact's path may be a directory rather than just a file. The print-message template takes an input artifact named message, unpacks it at the path named /tmp/message and then prints the contents of /tmp/message using the cat command.\nThe artifact-example template passes the hello-art artifact generated as an output of the generate-artifact step as the message input artifact to the print-message step. DAG templates use the tasks prefix to refer to another task, for example {{tasks.generate-artifact.outputs.artifacts.hello-art}}.\nThe Structure of Workflow Specs\nWe now know enough about the basic components of a workflow spec to review its basic structure:\n\nKubernetes header including metadata\n\nSpec body\n\nEntrypoint invocation with optionally arguments\nList of template definitions\n\n\nFor each template definition\n\nName of the template\nOptionally a list of inputs\nOptionally a list of outputs\nContainer invocation (leaf template) or a list of steps\nFor each step, a template invocation\n\n\n\n\n\nTo summarize, workflow specs are composed of a set of Argo templates where each template consists of an optional input section, an optional output section and either a container invocation or a list of steps where each step invokes another template.\nNote that the controller section of the workflow spec will accept the same options as the controller section of a pod spec, including but not limited to environment variables, secrets, and volume mounts. Similarly, for volume claims and volumes.\nSecrets\nArgo supports the same secrets syntax and mechanisms as Kubernetes Pod specs, which allows access to secrets as environment variables or volume mounts. See the (Kubernetes documentation)[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/] for more information.\n# To run this example, first create the secret by running:\n# kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=mypassword=S00perS3cretPa55word\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  generateName: secret-example-\nspec:\n  entrypoint: whalesay\n  # To access secrets as files, add a volume entry in spec.volumes[] and\n  # then in the container template spec, add a mount using volumeMounts.\n  volumes:\n  - name: my-secret-vol\n    secret:\n      secretName: my-secret     # name of an existing k8s secret\n  templates:\n  - name: whalesay\n    container:\n      image: alpine:3.7\n      command: [sh, -c]\n      args: ['\n        echo \"secret from env: $MYSECRETPASSWORD\";\n        echo \"secret from file: `cat /secret/mountpath/mypassword`\"\n      ']\n      # To access secrets as environment variables, use the k8s valueFrom and\n      # secretKeyRef constructs.\n      env:\n      - name: MYSECRETPASSWORD  # name of env var\n        valueFrom:\n          secretKeyRef:\n            name: my-secret     # name of an existing k8s secret\n            key: mypassword     # 'key' subcomponent of the secret\n      volumeMounts:\n      - name: my-secret-vol     # mount file containing secret at /secret/mountpath\n        mountPath: \"/secret/mountpath\"\nScripts & Results\nOften, we just want a template that executes a script specified as a here-script (also known as a here document) in the workflow spec. This example shows how to do that:\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  generateName: scripts-bash-\nspec:\n  entrypoint: bash-script-example\n  templates:\n  - name: bash-script-example\n    steps:\n    - - name: generate\n        template: gen-random-int-bash\n    - - name: print\n        template: print-message\n        arguments:\n          parameters:\n          - name: message\n            value: \"{{steps.generate.outputs.result}}\"  # The result of the here-script\n\n  - name: gen-random-int-bash\n    script:\n      image: debian:9.4\n      command: [bash]\n      source: |                                         # Contents of the here-script\n        cat /dev/urandom | od -N2 -An -i | awk -v f=1 -v r=100 '{printf \"%i\\n\", f + r * $1 / 65536}'\n\n  - name: gen-random-int-python\n    script:\n      image: python:alpine3.6\n      command: [python]\n      source: |\n        import random\n        i = random.randint(1, 100)\n        print(i)\n\n  - name: gen-random-int-javascript\n    script:\n      image: node:9.1-alpine\n      command: [node]\n      source: |\n        var rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);\n        console.log(rand);\n\n  - name: print-message\n    inputs:\n      parameters:\n      - name: message\n    container:\n      image: alpine:latest\n      command: [sh, -c]\n      args: [\"echo result was: {{inputs.parameters.message}}\"]\nThe script keyword allows the specification of the script body using the source tag. This creates a temporary file containing the script body and then passes the name of the temporary file as the final parameter to command, which should be an interpreter that executes the script body.\nThe use of the script feature also assigns the standard output of running the script to a special output parameter named result. This allows you to use the result of running the script itself in the rest of the workflow spec. In this example, the result is simply echoed by the print-message template.\nOutput Parameters\nOutput parameters provide a general mechanism to use the result of a step as a parameter rather than as an artifact. This allows you to use the result from any type of step, not just a script, for conditional tests, loops, and arguments. Output parameters work similarly to script result except that the value of the output parameter is set to the contents of a generated file rather than the contents of stdout.\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  generateName: output-parameter-\nspec:\n  entrypoint: output-parameter\n  templates:\n  -

Note that the daemons will be automatically destroyed when the workflow exits the template scope in which the daemon was invoked. Deamon containers are useful for starting up services to be tested or to be used in testing (e.g., fixtures). We also find it very useful when running large simulations to spin up a database as a daemon for collecting and organizing the results. The big advantage of daemons compared with sidecars is that their existence can persist across multiple steps or even the entire workflow.\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  generateName: daemon-step-\nspec:\n  entrypoint: daemon-example\n  templates:\n  - name: daemon-example\n    steps:\n    - - name: influx\n        template: influxdb              # start an influxdb as a daemon (see the influxdb template spec below)\n\n    - - name: init-database             # initialize influxdb\n        template: influxdb-client\n        arguments:\n          parameters:\n          - name: cmd\n            value: curl -XPOST 'http://{{steps.influx.ip}}:8086/query' --data-urlencode \"q=CREATE DATABASE mydb\"\n\n    - - name: producer-1                # add entries to influxdb\n        template: influxdb-client\n        arguments:\n          parameters:\n          - name: cmd\n            value: for i in $(seq 1 20); do curl -XPOST 'http://{{steps.influx.ip}}:8086/write?db=mydb' -d \"cpu,host=server01,region=uswest load=$i\" ; sleep .5 ; done\n      - name: producer-2                # add entries to influxdb\n        template: influxdb-client\n        arguments:\n          parameters:\n          - name: cmd\n            value: for i in $(seq 1 20); do curl -XPOST 'http://{{steps.influx.ip}}:8086/write?db=mydb' -d \"cpu,host=server02,region=uswest load=$((RANDOM % 100))\" ; sleep .5 ; done\n      - name: producer-3                # add entries to influxdb\n        template: influxdb-client\n        arguments:\n          parameters:\n          - name: cmd\n            value: curl -XPOST 'http://{{steps.influx.ip}}:8086/write?db=mydb' -d 'cpu,host=server03,region=useast load=15.4'\n\n    - - name: consumer                  # consume intries from influxdb\n        template: influxdb-client\n        arguments:\n          parameters:\n          - name: cmd\n            value: curl --silent -G http://{{steps.influx.ip}}:8086/query?pretty=true --data-urlencode \"db=mydb\" --data-urlencode \"q=SELECT * FROM cpu\"\n\n  - name: influxdb\n    daemon: true                        # start influxdb as a daemon\n    container:\n      image: influxdb:1.2\n      restartPolicy: Always             # restart container if it fails\n      readinessProbe:                   # wait for readinessProbe to succeed\n        httpGet:\n          path: /ping\n          port: 8086\n\n  - name: influxdb-client\n    inputs:\n      parameters:\n      - name: cmd\n    container:\n      image: appropriate/curl:latest\n      command: [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\"]\n      args: [\"{{inputs.parameters.cmd}}\"]\n      resources:\n        requests:\n          memory: 32Mi\n          cpu: 100m\nDAG templates use the tasks prefix to refer to another task, for example {{tasks.influx.ip}}.\nSidecars\nA sidecar is another container that executes concurrently in the same pod as the main container and is useful in creating multi-container pods.\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  generateName: sidecar-nginx-\nspec:\n  entrypoint: sidecar-nginx-example\n  templates:\n  - name: sidecar-nginx-example\n    container:\n      image: appropriate/curl\n      command: [sh, -c]\n      # Try to read from nginx web server until it comes up\n      args: [\"until `curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1/' >& /tmp/out`; do echo sleep && sleep 1; done && cat /tmp/out\"]\n    # Create a simple nginx web server\n    sidecars:\n    - name: nginx\n      image: nginx:1.13\nIn the above example, we create a sidecar container that runs nginx as a simple web server. The order in which containers come up is random, so in this example the main container polls the nginx container until it is ready to service requests. This is a good design pattern when designing multi-container systems: always wait for any services you need to come up before running your main code.\nHardwired Artifacts\nWith Argo, you can use any container image that you like to generate any kind of artifact. In practice, however, we find certain types of artifacts are very common, so there is built-in support for git, http, and s3 artifacts.\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  generateName: hardwired-artifact-\nspec:\n  entrypoint: hardwired-artifact\n  templates:\n  - name: hardwired-artifact\n    inputs:\n      artifacts:\n      # Check out the master branch of the argo repo and place it at /src\n      # revision can be anything that git checkout accepts: branch, commit, tag, etc.\n      - name: argo-source\n        path: /src\n        git:\n          repo: https://github.com/argoproj/argo.git\n          revision: \"master\"\n      # Download kubectl 1.8.0 and place it at /bin/kubectl\n      - name: kubectl\n        path: /bin/kubectl\n        mode: 0755\n        http:\n          url: https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.8.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl\n      # Copy an s3 bucket and place it at /s3\n      - name: objects\n        path: /s3\n        s3:\n          endpoint: storage.googleapis.com\n          bucket: my-bucket-name\n          key: path/in/bucket\n          accessKeySecret:\n            name: my-s3-credentials\n            key: accessKey\n          secretKeySecret:\n            name: my-s3-credentials\n            key: secretKey\n    container:\n      image: debian\n      command: [sh, -c]\n      args: [\"ls -l /src /bin/kubectl /s3\"]\nKubernetes Resources\nIn many cases, you will want to manage Kubernetes resources from Argo workflows. The resource template allows you to create, delete or updated any type of Kubernetes resource.\n# in a workflow. The resource template type accepts any k8s manifest\n# (including CRDs) and can perform any kubectl action against it (e.g. create,\n# apply, delete, patch).\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  generateName: k8s-jobs-\nspec:\n  entrypoint: pi-tmpl\n  templates:\n  - name: pi-tmpl\n    resource:                   # indicates that this is a resource template\n      action: create            # can be any kubectl action (e.g. create, delete, apply, patch)\n      # The successCondition and failureCondition are optional expressions.\n      # If failureCondition is true, the step is considered failed.\n      # If successCondition is true, the step is considered successful.\n      # They use kubernetes label selection syntax and can be applied against any field\n      # of the resource (not just labels). Multiple AND conditions can be represented by comma\n      # delimited expressions.\n      # For more details: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/\n      successCondition: status.succeeded > 0\n      failureCondition: status.failed > 3\n      manifest: |               #put your kubernetes spec here\n        apiVersion: batch/v1\n        kind: Job\n        metadata:\n          generateName: pi-job-\n        spec:\n          template:\n            metadata:\n              name: pi\n            spec:\n              containers:\n              - name: pi\n                image: perl\n                command: [\"perl\",  \"-Mbignum=bpi\", \"-wle\", \"print bpi(2000)\"]\n              restartPolicy: Never\n          backoffLimit: 4\nResources created in this way are independent of the workflow. If you want the resource to be deleted when the workflow is deleted then you can use Kubernetes garbage collection with the workflow resource as an owner reference (example).\nDocker-in-Docker Using Sidecars\nAn application of sidecars is to implement Docker-in-Docker (DinD). DinD is useful when you want to run Docker commands from inside a container. For example, you may want to build and push a container image from inside your build container. In the following example, we use the docker:dind container to run a Docker daemon in a sidecar and give the main container access to the daemon.\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  generateName: sidecar-dind-\nspec:\n  entrypoint: dind-sidecar-example\n  templates:\n  - name: dind-sidecar-example\n    container:\n      image: docker:17.10\n      command: [sh, -c]\n      args: [\"until docker ps; do sleep 3; done; docker run --rm debian:latest cat /etc/os-release\"]\n      env:\n      - name: DOCKER_HOST               # the docker daemon can be access on the standard port on localhost\n        value: 127.0.0.1\n    sidecars:\n    - name: dind\n      image: docker:17.10-dind          # Docker already provides an image for running a Docker daemon\n      securityContext:\n        privileged: true                # the Docker daemon can only run in a privileged container\n      # mirrorVolumeMounts will mount the same volumes specified in the main container\n      # to the sidecar (including artifacts), at the same mountPaths. This enables\n      # dind daemon to (partially) see the same filesystem as the main container in\n      # order to use features such as docker volume binding.\n      mirrorVolumeMounts: true\nContinuous Integration Example\nContinuous integration is a popular application for workflows. Currently, Argo does not provide event triggers for automatically kicking off your CI jobs, but we plan to do so in the near future. Until then, you can easily write a cron job that checks for new commits and kicks off the needed workflow, or use your existing Jenkins server to kick off the workflow.\nA good example of a CI workflow spec is provided at https://github.com/argoproj/argo/tree/master/examples/influxdb-ci.yaml. Because it just uses the concepts that we've already covered and is somewhat long, we don't go into details here.\n"},"argo/hooks/readme":{"id":"argo/hooks/readme","title":"argo/hooks/readme","body":"Docker Hub Automated Build Hooks\nThis directory contains Docker Hub Automated Build hooks.\nThis is needed since we publish multiple images as part of a single build:\n\nargoproj/workflow-controller:latest\nargoproj/argoexec:latest\nargoproj/argocli:latest\n\nIt relies the DOCKER_REPO and DOCKER_TAG environment variables that are set by Docker Hub during\nthe build.\nHooks can be tested using:\nDOCKER_REPO=index.docker.io/my-docker-username/workflow-controller DOCKER_TAG=latest ./hooks/build\nDOCKER_REPO=index.docker.io/my-docker-username/workflow-controller DOCKER_TAG=latest ./hooks/push"},"argo/manifests/readme":{"id":"argo/manifests/readme","title":"argo/manifests/readme","body":"Argo Install Manifests\nTwo sets of manifests are provided:\n\n\n\nFile\nDescription\n\n\n\ninstall.yaml\nStandard argo cluster-wide installation.
