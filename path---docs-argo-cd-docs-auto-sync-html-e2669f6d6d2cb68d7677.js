A benefit of automatic sync is that\nCI/CD pipelines no longer need direct access to the ArgoCD API server to perform the deployment.\nInstead, the pipeline makes a commit and push to the git repository with the changes to the\nmanifests in the tracking git repo.</p>\n<p>To configure automated sync run:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-bash">argocd app set &#x3C;APPNAME> --sync-policy automated \n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively, if creating the application an application manifest, specify a syncPolicy with an\n<code>automated</code> policy.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-yaml">spec:\n  syncPolicy:\n    automated: {}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Automatic Pruning</h2>\n<p>By default (and as a safety mechanism), automated sync will not delete resources when ArgoCD detects\nthe resource is no longer defined in git. To prune the resources, a manual sync can always be\nperformed (with pruning checked). Pruning can also be enabled to happen automatically as part of the\nautomated sync by running:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-bash">argocd app set &#x3C;APPNAME> --auto-prune\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or by setting the prune option to true in the automated sync policy:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-yaml">spec:\n  syncPolicy:\n    automated:\n      prune: true\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Automated Sync Semantics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>An automated sync will only be performed if the application is OutOfSync. Applications in a\nSynced or error state will not attempt automated sync.</li>\n<li>Automated sync will only attempt one synchronization per unique combination of commit SHA1 and\napplication parameters. If the most recent successful sync in the history was already performed\nagainst the same commit-SHA and parameters, a second sync will not be attempted.</li>\n<li>Automatic sync will not reattempt a sync if the previous sync attempt against the same commit-SHA\nand parameters had failed.</li>\n<li>Rollback cannot be performed against an application with automated sync enabled.</li>\n</ul>',docPath:"argo-cd/docs/auto_sync",proj:"argo-cd"}}}});
