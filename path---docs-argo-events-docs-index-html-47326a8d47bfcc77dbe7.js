Designed from the ground-up as Kubernetes-native.</li>\n<li>Extremely lightweight. All signals, with exception of calendar based signals, are event-driven, meaning there is no polling involved.</li>\n<li>Configurable. Choose which signals to support and only deploy those you want to Kubernetes.</li>\n<li>Scalability &#x26; Resilient. Signal sources run as stateless microservices enabling you to scale simply by increasing the deployment replicas.</li>\n<li>Simple or Complex dependencies. Manage everything from simple, linear, real-time dependencies to complex, multi-source batch job dependencies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Basics</h2>\n<p>Argo Events is an open source event-based dependency manager for Kubernetes. The core concept of the project are <code>sensors</code> which are implemented as a Kubernetes-native Custom Resource Definition that define a set of dependencies (inputs) and actions (outputs). The sensor\'s actions will only be triggered after it\'s dependencies have been resolved.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define multiple dependencies from a variety of sources</li>\n<li>Plugin custom signal microservices to support business-level constraint logic</li>\n<li>Trigger messages and Kubernetes object creation after successful dependency resolution</li>\n<li>Trigger escalation after errors, or dependency constraint failures</li>\n<li>Build and manage a distributed, cross-team, event-driven architecture</li>\n<li>Easily leverage Kubernetes native APIs to monitor dependencies</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Learn More</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="quickstart.html">Quickstart</a></li>\n<li><a href="signal-guide.html">Signals</a></li>\n<li><a href="trigger-guide.html">Triggers</a></li>\n</ul>',docPath:"argo-events/docs/index",proj:"argo-events"}}}});
